## Project Summary

WYDRN is a Social Networking website where you can track your movies, TV shows, games, books, and music. The aim of this project is to provide a centralized platform to track all your favorite media, eliminating the need to use multiple platforms like IMDB, Goodreads, Steam, RateYourMusic, and TVTime. It's one platform to rule them all!
