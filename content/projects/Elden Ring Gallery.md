## Learnings

Throughout the development of the Elden Ring Gallery, I gained valuable insights and honed my skills in several areas:

- **Image optimization**: I learned techniques to optimize large-sized images to ensure faster loading times and optimal performance of the gallery.

- **Custom animations**: By leveraging Anime.js, I was able to create captivating and fluid animations for the 3D gallery format, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **Efficient image loading**: To handle a vast number of images, I utilized JavaScript loops to efficiently load and render the images dynamically to HTML using the Document Object Model (DOM).

- **CI/CD with GitHub Pages**: I implemented Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Pages, enabling seamless deployment and updates to the live gallery.
