## Project Summary

This is a web application built with Streamlit that allows users to analyze data from various entertainment platforms. The Entertainment Data Analysis Web Application is a powerful tool for analyzing data from popular entertainment platforms such as Goodreads, Letterboxd, and Steam. It provides users with advanced data analysis techniques, statistical reports, and in-depth insights that are not available on the platforms themselves.

The application offers several services:

### Goodreads Report

With the Goodreads Analysis Report, users can upload their export CSV file from their Goodreads account and gain valuable insights. The tool utilizes advanced data analysis techniques to generate statistical reports and provide in-depth analysis that goes beyond what the Goodreads platform offers.

### Bulk Quote Scraper

The Goodreads Quote Scraper is a data science app built with Streamlit. Users can scrape quotes from the popular book social networking site called Goodreads. By selecting their favorite author and setting the limit of pages to scrape, users can obtain a CSV file containing all the data they need.

### Letterboxd Movie Analysis Report

For Letterboxd users, the Letterboxd Movie Analysis Report simplifies the process of gaining insights from their exported CSV file. The tool employs advanced data analysis techniques to generate statistical reports and provide in-depth insights that go beyond what the Letterboxd platform offers.

### Steam Game Analysis Report

With the Steam Game Analysis Report, users can upload their Steam library export CSV file and gain comprehensive insights. The tool utilizes advanced data analysis techniques to generate statistical reports and provide in-depth analysis that goes beyond what the Steam platform offers.

### Genius Lyrics to PDF

The Genius Lyrics to PDF tool allows users to export lyrics and annotations for any desired album into a rich Markdown format or a PDF file. By inputting the album name and artist name, users can generate a markdown or PDF file containing lyrics and annotations for every track off the album. No more wasted time searching for lyrics online or trying to decipher song meanings on your own!

### Letterboxd to Blog

Letterboxd to Blog simplifies the process of generating blog posts based on the movies users have watched on Letterboxd. Users can create a markdown file containing their reviews and ratings for the movies they have watched in the latest month. This tool is perfect for automating the process of creating blog posts based on movie reviews and ratings.
