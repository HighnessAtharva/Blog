Embarking on a massive high fantasy book series is no small feat, especially when you're looking for a breathtaking, complex, and engaging story that spans decades and continents. As an experienced reader of ASoIaF, WoT, Tchaikovsky's works, Mistborn, and the First Law Trilogy, I knew I needed a challenge that would test my mettle.

Enter the Malazan Book of the Fallen. With rave reviews and a reputation for being one of the most epic fantasy series ever written, it seemed like the perfect choice for me. So, in 2022, I dived headfirst into the first book of the series, Gardens of the Moon. And oh boy, was I blown away by the sheer scale and scope of the book. It was everything I hoped for and more.

Filled with excitement and high expectations, I immediately picked up Deadhouse Gates after finishing Gardens of the Moon. And the opening chapters did not disappoint. But as fate would have it, life got in the way, and I had to put the book down to deal with the responsibilities of adulthood. I lost my momentum and before I knew it, I had traded in my complex high fantasy reads for lighter, easier options.

Fast forward to 2023, and I've made the decision to finally finish the series. Armed with a lot of free time and a burning desire to tackle this mammoth of a series, I'm halfway through my reread of Gardens of the Moon. This time, however, I'm determined to push through and keep up with all the characters, no matter how complex or challenging it gets.

I know what I'm in for this time around, and that gives me tremendous confidence to topple this series once and for all. With the added bonus of it being incredibly well-written, richly worded, and immaculately crafted, it's sure to be a wild ride that I can't wait to experience. Here's to finally conquering the Malazan Book of the Fallen!

I am embarking on an epic journey to read the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, and I couldn't be more excited! My plan is to read all ten books in the series this year, in the order of publication. While I'm not entirely sure I'll be able to complete the task, I'm determined to give it my best shot. I do not own paperbacks or hardcovers of the books. I have the ebooks on my kindle and I am reading them there. As I progress through each book, I'll be posting a review within a week of finishing it. And once I've finished the entire series, I plan to post a comprehensive review of the entire experience.

To help keep track of the complex narrative and the vast array of characters, I've created a custom-made summary compendium. It took a lot of hard work to create, but I believe it will be an invaluable resource throughout my reading journey.

And for the maps, I'm using an excellent website that has been recommended to me by many Malazan fans.

To supplement my reading, I'll also be an active member of the Malazan Discord server. It's a great community where I can discuss my thoughts and questions with other fans of the series. And if I need to look up anything non-spoilery, I'll be turning to the Malazan Wiki.

While I'm a little late to the party, I'm eager to dive into this series and see what all the fuss is about. With the Elder Gods willing and the encouragement from my fellow Malazan fans, I'm confident that I can reach my goal. So please, cheer me on down in the comments, and let's get started on this epic adventure together!
