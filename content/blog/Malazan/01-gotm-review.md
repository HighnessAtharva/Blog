**Rating:** 4/5 ‚≠ê

The Gardens of the Moon, the first volume of the Malazan Book of the Fallen, is a sprawling epic fantasy of monumental proportions. The vast array of characters is not just diverse, but uniquely and exquisitely crafted, and each of their roles is pivotal to the story's advancement. There are no throwaway scenes or chapters; every dialogue and action ripples and reverberates throughout the intricate narrative, creating a vivid tapestry of political intrigue, mystical manipulation, and fantastical landscapes.

Upon embarking on the Malazan Book of the Fallen Vol 1 - "Gardens of the Moon," I was initially intimidated by its sheer scope, as many fellow online enthusiasts had warned me of its formidable length. Having already delved into the intricate worlds of ASoIaF, WoT, Tchaikovsky's works, Mistborn, and the First Law Trilogy, I felt confident in my fantasy reading prowess. However, my apprehension soon dissipated upon immersing myself into the first few chapters of the novel, and I quickly realized that my fears were unfounded.

The book's incredible length may be daunting, but its enthralling tale draws the reader in, and the full-blown battle in Chapter 2 is a breathtaking display of military expertise and magical prowess. Death is not the finality it is in other cultures, as souls can be rekindled and transmuted into different forms under divine intervention. The Warrens, the novel's unique magical system, are utterly captivating, and the rich geographical diversity and detailed locations paint a cinematic picture of this fantastical world.

The characters are not just fresh canvases but unique anomalies in fantasy literature. From the Bridgeburners to Anomander Rake, each character shines in their own way, and their actions and dialogues are utterly spellbinding. The action scenes are masterfully done, with the sword fights and mage battles truly epic in scope and spectacle. The political machinations that Laseen, the empire's ruler, undertakes add an extra layer of intrigue to the plot, and her character demands a point-of-view to unravel her schemes fully. I am particularly intrigued by the character of Tattersail, who is a master of the Deck of Dragons and a powerful mage in her own right. Paran's character arc is also a joy to read, as he goes from a naive and inexperienced soldier to a hardened and battle-scarred veteran. None of the characters are perfect, and their flaws and shortcomings are what make them so relatable and human. Also, there is no silly love triangle or romance subplot to distract from the main plot, which is a welcome change from other fantasy novels.

The novel's themes of possession, manipulation, rebirth, and death are brilliantly woven into the plot, and the hounds add a fantastic otherworldly element to the tale. The prophecies, poems, and epigraphs preceding each chapter lend an air of heavy foreshadowing that only adds to the anticipation and excitement. The book's pacing is also excellent, with the action scenes and character POVs being well-balanced. The book's ending is also a grand culmination of the novel's themes, with the final battle being a fitting end to the book's epic nature.

The worldbuilding felt extensive and immersive, with a vast array of cultures, nations, and creatures. The naming conventions are diverse, with each race or nation having its own unique naming style, adding to the depth and richness of the world. The maps provided in the books also help to convey the geographical complexity of the world, with intricate details of different regions and territories.

The four founding races, K'Chain Che'Malle, Forkrul Assail, Jaghut, and Imass, are each distinct and fascinating in their own right. The K'Chain are ancient insectoid beings with a complex social structure and advanced technology, while the Forkrul are enigmatic and powerful beings with a mysterious history. The Jaghut are resilient and resilient, while the Imass are an ancient and formidable race of undead warriors.

The diversity of races and cultures in the Malazan world is another hallmark of the series. From the nomadic tribes of the Raraku desert to the powerful city-states of Quon Tali, the world is filled with a rich tapestry of peoples and nations. The deep worldbuilding also extends to the histories and mythologies of these cultures, adding to the sense of depth and authenticity.

Overall, this volume is a masterclass in worldbuilding, with a diverse cast of characters, intricate naming conventions, detailed maps, and a rich history and mythology. It is a world that rewards careful exploration and invites readers to immerse themselves fully in its depth and complexity.

Erikson's military background is evident in his exceptional writing of warfare scenes. His descriptions of the battles and their aftermaths are breathtaking, and the scenes in the sword Dragnipur are surreal and awe-inspiring. The final four chapters are a grand culmination of the book's epic nature, with dragons, assassins, mages, and swordfights all converging in a stunning display of epic fantasy.

While the book could have benefitted from better-defined character POVs and a more descriptive glossary, its pacing, characterizations, and prophecies are exceptional. It is a joy to read, and the desire to soak in every detail is palpable. The book sets up a grand narrative that promises even more fantastic elements and thrilling action in the next volume. Gardens of the Moon is a masterful start to the Malazan Book of the Fallen, and a must-read for fans of epic fantasy.

I am captivated and eager to press on, and in a few days' time, I will commence my journey with "Deadhouse Gates". Expect a review of that book in the coming weeks.
