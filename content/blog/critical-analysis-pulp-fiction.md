## Narrative

Pulp Fiction adopts a non-linear narrative with three protagonists, namely, Vincent Vega (a quirky hitman), Jules Winnfield (Vega’s partner in crime) and Butch Coolidge(a prizefighter). The movie is split into seven episodic events which do not follow a chronological order. All the episodic stories are a blend of genres and Tarantino is known to sprinkle various Easter-eggs and references throughout. That really binds all the scenes together. What fascinates me the most is that the scenes have absolutely no exposition dump and all the narrative themes as well as the plot lines are communicated to the audience through the bizarre, peculiar and anomalously stylistic lives of the protagonists in the form of coarse, vulgar and gritty dialogues.

Having watched this movie more times than I can remember, I have come to admire the dialogue-writing in this movie so much that I can perform any particular scene with no rehearsal. Every conversation in this movie feels intimate and is to be relished. Right from the start, the movie is a frenzied, reflective, humorous ride and most of the characters are unhinged. The narrative is distinctive because it defies convention and jolts every human sense with its wicked brutality and captivating fluidity.

## Screenplay

The dialogue is the soul of the movie. Pulp Fiction boasts the most iconic dialogues and the way the conversation flows between a pair of characters feels very spontaneous and natural and that is precisely the allure of this entire movie. It creates a vivid image without making the audience conscious of its beauty and remarkable direction and screenplay.

Frankly, I could listen to the scene with the dialogue *Royale with Cheese* endlessly and never get weary. Also, *Zed’s Dead, Baby, Zed’s Dead* is very witty and has a dark comedy flair to it. Samuel L. Jackson really set the standard with his *Ezekiel 25:17* monologue- it is truly rare to find such intensity, passion and commitment in modern cinema. The performances are lively and splendid, but I have to commend Samuel L. Jackson for captivating the audience here. The way he uttered his lines was menacing and sometimes even hilarious.

Towards the end of the movie, we see the seven tales converging towards each other and our protagonists entangled in each others destiny. This is the essence of Tarantino’s storytelling.

## Costumes and Set Design

The costumes in the movie may appear simplistic at first sight, with monochrome suits and vintage jumpsuits dominating the scene. However, a closer look reveals the subtle nuances and hints that Tarantino has embedded into the fabric of the film. These details unveil the inner workings and personalities of the gangsters and charming ladies that inhabit the movie. As I immersed myself in the film, I was mesmerized by the intricate details of the costumes. The monochrome suits, for instance, were not merely uniform, but rather customized to each character’s physique and persona. The vintage jumpsuits, likewise, were not just a nod to a past era, but rather an expression of the characters’ individual eccentricities and traits. Tarantino’s meticulousness is astounding, and it manifests in every facet of the film, from the costumes to the dialogue. As I watched the movie, I was transported to the world that he had crafted, a world that was both recognizable and yet utterly original. It is a demonstration of his prowess as a filmmaker that he is able to create such a rich and complex world, one that is both amusing and stimulating. In summary, the costumes in the movie are not just rudimentary garments, but rather a reflection of the characters’ identities and aspirations. Tarantino’s meticulousness is unrivaled, and it is this meticulousness that makes the movie such a riveting and compelling experience.

Tarantino took immaculate care to develop the characters through their stand-out in
your face fashion choices. The story is set in Las Vegas or a fictionalized version of it and
the fashion suits the time period.

## Soundtrack

Pulp Fiction is a mash-up of American pop, rock and roll, surf, and soul. Every single track has a style that fits the scenes and acts as a backbone in raising the audience's emotional commitment. There is no monotony because the music is appealing, rhythmic, and diverse. There is no shortage of groovy tunes and retro classics - the opening title flashes on the screen with the iconic *Misirlou* theme, *Son of a Preacher Man* perfectly capturing the mood when Vincent meets the godly Mia Wallace for the first time, and Ricky Nelson's *Lonesome Town* is both comforting and pensive.
Clearly, my favourite moment is the one in which Mia and Vincent show off their elegant and famous dancing routines to *You Can Never Tell*, an all-time classic in film history. *Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon* brilliantly conveys Mia's impending overdose and emphasises her extravagant lifestyle. In a nutshell, I adore every second of it, and it is really easy to say. Tarantino has an uncanny ability to select songs that become immediate favourites.

## Camera and Lighting

This film's passion and vibrant beauty cannot be denied. The quick pan of the camera, the close-up, grainy film filters, a sun washed colour scheme, and the kaleidoscopic narrative all come together in a masterpiece of total audacious violence combined with cruel perversity. During silly debates and unusual scenes, the camera remains very stable, making it uncomfortable and unsettling. The camera is placed from the characters' feet, in the trunk of the car when Travolta and Jackson lift it off, at diner tables and restaurants during the opening, focusing on facial expressions and hand gestures, and finally, far away during the dance-scene.

There are layers within layers, and it takes a keen eye to spot all the details hidden in plain sight, as Tarantino frequently uses gore in a "in your face" manner, making us overlook the other beautiful aspects on the frame. All of these placement strategies capture the rich language and colourful aural imagery of our diverse characters. The lighting in the pub scene, where we see the hulk of a character, totally menacing and the possible antagonist with his back to the camera and the room flooded with red light and smoke, is, to put it mildly, menacing.

## Awards and Accolades

## Closing Thoughts

The cinematic masterpiece, Pulp Fiction, is unequivocally a quintessential work of popular culture that elevated the status of cinema to a new level of prestige. Of course, like any art form, it is not without its imperfections. Nevertheless, Pulp Fiction effectively bridges the gap between cinematic perfection and artistic flaws.

The film embodies a plethora of elements that tantalize the senses and leave an indelible mark on the viewer's psyche. From the clever incorporation of pop culture references to the subtle religious metaphors, the movie immerses the audience in a world of edgy and provocative themes. Samuel L. Jackson's masterful use of expletives and slurs coupled with blood-soaked thrills and tempting fast food, create a symphony of sensory experiences.

The film's iconic dances, witty one-liners, and engaging dialogues, complemented by catchy tunes, are a testament to the movie's once-in-a-generation status. Pulp Fiction ushered in a new era of modern filmmaking, characterized by sophisticated yet whimsical narratives, memorable characters, kick-ass tunes, and bizarrely entertaining scenarios, that have stood the test of time.

Moreover, in my candid opinion, Mia Wallace is the quintessential character in all of cinema, whose effortless charm, wit, and grace, have captivated audiences for decades.
