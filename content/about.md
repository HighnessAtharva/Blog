My journey in the tech industry began early on as my fascination with the way computers work and the endless possibilities they offer led to teaching myself how to code and eventually turning my passion into a career. As a self-proclaimed "code cruncher," I possess a deep understanding of the programming language Python and enjoy exploring the many libraries and frameworks available. I also have experience with a variety of data analysis tools and enjoy using them to uncover insights and patterns in large sets of data.

I am an avid reader and am always on the lookout for the latest books. My reading preferences include Sci-Fi, High Fantasy, Fiction, Thrillers, and Supernatural. I am also a fan of graphic novels and mangas. I believe that staying informed and educated is crucial in this constantly evolving industry.

Not just a tech nerd, I also have other interests and hobbies such as being a cinephile and a music aficionado. I enjoy watching films from all over the world, and love to discuss and debate the merits of different films and directors. I have a particular soft spot for classic, neo-noir, psychological thrillers and horror films. I enjoy traveling and exploring new places, and as a programmer, I fall into the Venn Diagram of a "gamer" and "nerd." I enjoy playing video games and have a particular fondness for RPGs and strategy games. I also enjoy playing board games and card games with my friends.

My taste in music is diverse, and I enjoy listening to everything from classic rock to hip-hop and electronic music. I love discovering new artists and attending live music events. I believe that music is a powerful tool that can evoke emotions and create memories.

I have had the opportunity to work in a few different roles in the tech industry, and have developed a variety of skills including working as a software developer, a data analyst and a consultant. Each role has taught me something new, and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.

I am a strong believer in the power of technology to make positive change in the world and am passionate about using my skills and knowledge to help others and make a difference. I have volunteered for various non-profit organizations and have participated in hackathons to develop solutions for social and environmental issues.

Overall, I am a dedicated, hard-working and curious person. I am always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges. I believe that the world of technology is constantly evolving and there is always more to discover. I am excited to see where my journey in this field will take me next.
