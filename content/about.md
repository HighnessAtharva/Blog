## What's My Primary Technology Stack?

I'm a Python guy at heart, juggling my passions for machine learning, data science, and web development. From crafting fancy CLIs to whipping up file handling scripts and performing bulk data magic, I'm your go-to guy for all things Pythonic.

And let's not forget my love affair with Jupyter Notebook, where data analysis and machine learning projects come to life!  In the realm of web development, Django is my true love. HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, and SSGs like Hugo are my trusty sidekicks, helping me build sleek and snappy static sites in a breeze. I made my most complex project yet using PHP. I'm fascinated by React.js and Next.js but I've yet to prove my worth.

I often work with CSVs. NLP has piqued my interest and I've been neck deep into the SpaCy library. It is adorable.

When it comes to data-intensive apps, Streamlit has my heart. It's the perfect companion for data analysis and visualization, while Seaborn and Matplotlib add that extra flair to my visualizations!  Seaborn and Matplotlib also come handy.

I'm no stranger to Google Cloud Platform, and I'm currently on a quest for AWS SAC-002 certification. The cloud's the limit!

But the journey doesn't end there! I've set my sights on mastering React, Docker, Django Rest Framework, and venturing into the exciting realms of blockchain and AI. I'll also be tinkering with deployment and scaling strategies—there's always room for growth and exploration!

## What do I Read? What are my favorite authors and works?

In the realm of words and wonders, I find solace and delight. My literary appetite knows no bounds, from technical blogs to spine-chilling horror, and everything in between. A curious connoisseur, I traverse the realms of fantasy, science fiction, and classic literature, savoring each tale like a fine elixir.

All of my reading happens either on my Amazon Kindle or my laptop. For as long as I remember I have been using [FB Reader](https://fbreader.org/) for Ebook Reading (MOBI, EPUB) are comfortable formats. I use [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) (the only sane choice) for library management and conversion. I exclusively read comics and graphic novels on [YACReader Library](https://yacreader.com/) with the CBZ/CBR formats. For manga, I use Tachiyomi on Android or [TachiDesk](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk-Server) for the desktop, great clients to fetch the latest chapters from a variety of scanlated sources.

Enough about the software, let's get to some of my favorites. Note that this is not an exhaustive list. It may also be outdated.

- **Blogs and Newsletters** - DjangoStars, Smashing Magazine, Codrops, WIRED, ByteByteGo, etc. Too many to list.

- **Fantasy** - Lord of the Rings, Witcher, Wardstone Chronicles, Skulduggery Pleasant, Wheel of Time, Malazan, The Broken Empire, The First Law Trilogy, etc.

- **Science Fiction** - Discworld, Works of Patrick Ness, Mistborn, Ready Player One and the works of Philip K. Dick among others.

- **Horror** - H.P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allen Poe, Ray Bradbury, Stephen King, and a choice of pulp magazines, novellas and anthologies.

- **Classic Literature** - The Little Prince, The Great Gatsby, Catcher In The Rye, 1984, Animal Farm, Robin Hood, The Legend of King Arthur, etc.

- **Graphic Novels** - Watchmen, Sandman, Preacher, Sin City, Spiderman, Batman, Conan the Barbarian, etc. I have read several indie comics!

- **Manga** - Naruto, Dragon Ball, Berserk, One Piece, Yotsuba!, Dragon Ball, etc. I am a straight up shonen and seinen reader.

Gothic literature's eerie embrace, action-packed thrillers, and the enigmatic world of cultist and paranormal tales leave me craving more. Medieval sword and shield fantasies bestow upon me the thrill of chivalrous quests.

Mystery, charm, and a love for the written word bind my soul. In this literary labyrinth, my imagination soars, seeking stories that stir the senses and spark the imagination. A dance with words and worlds, forever enchanting, forever seeking the next page to turn.

## What do I Watch? What are my favorite directors, movies and TV shows?

As a silver screen devotee and TV aficionado, I savor the world of video entertainment, with a penchant for movies over TV shows. Animated gems and anime hold a special place in my heart, and Studio Ghibli's enchanting creations leave me in awe. A24's masterpieces consistently exceed expectations, while indie and underground movies cast their unique spell on my imagination.

Gory and extreme B-movies from the golden era tantalize me, a nostalgic journey reminiscent of the 80s and 90s. Horror, sci-fi, and fantasy films enthrall me. Try not to recommend me documentaries and biopics. They rarely captivate my interest.

An audacious soundtrack, a whacky or entertaining plotline, a charming or atmospheric setting, and an unexpected climax—these elements fuel my cinematic desires.

Here's a few of my most liked movies across the genres. Note that this is not an exhaustive list. It may also be outdated.

- **Horror** - Suspiria, Possession, and Evil Dead, Friday the 13th.

- **Thriller** - The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl, Nightcrawler, and Get Out.

- **Animation** - End of Evangelion, Spirited Away, It's such a beautiful day, and Into the Spiderverse.

- **Western and War** - The Dollars Trilogy, Django Unchained, 1917, and Saving Private Ryan.

- **Romance** - La La Land, Lost in Translation, Before Sunrise, and Her.

- **SciFi** -  classics like Clockwork Orange, Ex Machina, The Prestige, Matrix, and Blade Runner 2049.

- **Comedy** - The Big Lebowski, The Grand Budapest Hotel, The Nice Guys, The Wolf of Wall Street, and The Hangover.

**Favorite Directors** - Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Gaspar Noe, David Lynch, Christopher Nolan, Alfred Hitchcock, Hayao Miyazaki, Makoto Shinkai, Wes Anderson, Edgar Wright.

I've watched too many TV shows to count but if I had to pick top 10 off the top of my head it would be Game of Thrones, Succession, Black Mirror, The Boys, Vikings, Sharp Objects, End of the F***ing World, Attack on Titan, Dragon Ball Z, Breaking Bad.

Letterboxd is my companion, crafting lists, tracking ratings, and offering a portal to my cinematic musings. From monthly movie reviews to exploring new films, it is a treasure trove for the cinephile in me. The silver screen's allure beckons, and I embark on an enchanting quest through captivating realms of celluloid wonders.

## What is my music taste like? What genre and artists do I prefer?

Some genres that I have been enjoying are alternative, rock, hip hop, rap, electronic, soundtrack, ambient, indie, pop, and retro. I am a sucker for 80s and 90s music. I am not a fan of metal, country, and jazz. I am not a fan of K-pop either, well sometimes.

I'll let the visuals speak for this one.

## Do you even game bro?

'Course I do! Growing up, I was knee-deep in pixels and polygons before I could tie my shoelaces properly.

Parkouring across rooftops in Prince of Persia, causing virtual chaos in Grand Theft Auto, and silently stalking targets in Assassin's Creed—these games were my initiation into the gaming world. They weren't just games; they were adventures.

Fast forward a bit, and I stumbled upon the world of indie games and metroidvanias. It was like finding a treasure chest full of gems. Hollow Knight? A masterpiece. GRIS? A work of art. Shadows of Mordor? An orc-slaying extravaganza. These games weren't just fun; they were emotional rollercoasters.

And then there are isometric games. Hades? The devilishly good time I never knew I needed Cult of the Lamb? It's like a fuzzy, adorable nightmare. These games proved that perspective is everything.

Speaking of perspective, Devolver Digital—these folks know how to twist it. Their games are like a wild fever dream. They're quirky, they're bold, and they're impossible to forget. Devolver Digital isn't just a game developer; they're a mad genius behind the screen.

Of course, I can't forget the classics: Far Cry's exotic landscapes, Tomb Raider's adventurous spirit, Doom's relentless chaos, and Call of Duty's adrenaline-pumping battles. These games shaped the gaming industry and carved a special place in my heart.

So, there you have it—a peek into my gaming journey. From rooftops to dungeons, from indie gems to triple-A classics.
