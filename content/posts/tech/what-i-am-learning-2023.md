## FastAPI

Next, I'm gonna take FastAPI for a spin üèé. This new web framework is all the rage these days and I wanna see what all the hype is about. Plus, it's built on top of Starlette and Pydantic, and promises to be easy, fast and efficient. I'm ready to put it to the test and compare it to other popular options like Flask and Django.

[**<u>My Checklist</u>**](#)

- Installation and setup
- Basic routing and endpoint creation
- Handling request data and parameters
- Creating and using models
- Advanced routing and endpoint creation
- Query string and path parameters

- Using WebSockets
- Creating and using custom decorators, exception handlers, middleware, authentication, directive, exception, security, filter and event
- Using OpenAPI and Swagger
- Deployment and scaling
- Using FastAPI with databases
- Testing and debugging
- Integrating with other libraries and frameworks
- Best practices and design patterns for building web applications with FastAPI.

[**<u>Completion Goals</u>**](#)

## AWS and Docker

AWS and Docker are the cherry on top üçí. AWS is a cloud computing platform that offers a wide range of services to build, deploy and manage applications. I'm looking forward to exploring the platform and learning how to use its various services to improve the scalability and reliability of my applications. Docker, on the other hand, is a platform for building, shipping, and running distributed applications. It allows for easy deployment and management of applications, and is a great tool for creating a consistent development environment across different machines.

[**<u>My Checklist</u>**](#)

- AWS basics and services
- Setting up and managing EC2 instances
- Working with AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
- Containerizing applications with Docker
