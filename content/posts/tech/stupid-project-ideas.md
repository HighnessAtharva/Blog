## 1. Vibe Check

A tool to get the blue-you to the happy-you.

- What its not!: It's not a bullshit woke app that plays you your favorite song, puts on zen pics or show you doggo pics.
- Its a tool that will help you get out of your funk. This is done by memes, hardcore music, incantations, bizzare sounds and other chaotic and funny stuff that is not superficial.
- Throwing ideas at the wall: This tool will daily/biweekly/weekly send you memes that are suiting to your character. Just input the pop culture media shows you have seen, your favorite actors and bands and shit and this will give you a vibe check.
- Just subscribe to this and these memes will make a joke out of you for being a cuck and feeling down and give you soldier boy style hardcore ted talks and insults. Basically, sign up to get bullied by the wierd and funny shit on the internet to cope harder and kick out your loser self.
- Some memes of Vegeta and Goku pitying you and giving you a ted talk to go super saiyan.
- Maybe 100 Gecs dancing around and Jockstrap music performances live.
- Need to iron out the detail and the algo to make it work from person to person. Probably even need a curator to collect and assort 50-100 memes/videos/ideas for 12-15 personalities. Also 450-500 quotes. 50 for each personality. That will be enough material.
- Need a minimalist platform that will be like a feed where you send your depressed ass to get powered tf up and get to work.
- This is for people who are not lame and naive - who don't want sunshine, rainbows, icecream and some bullshit self-improvement lecture but want to practically minimize their blueness and get funky and work to soon.
- A shit ton of memes, not self-asserting but self-diminishing. Dominating videos, characters and enriching performances or songs that play that match your mood. Not lonely, down bad or depressing songs. Can be self-assertive like Would? by Alice in Chain, China Girl by David Bowie or Eyes without a face by Billy Idol that are groovy but not like the sad girl starter pack shit.
- Interface must be absolutely minimal, no other settings, just your feed and account. No friends, no chat, no messages, just a wall of people or memes shouting at you to get back to work and stop being depressed.
- Add paywall to access more frequently. Free tier can give you 2 sessions limited to 5 memes each session.
- Snowflakes are banned. Damn them.
- Bomb the user with self-affirmation mantra but not that cheesy ass shit. Bomb them with footage of deathing grips owning the stage, Alice Glass going wild, Goku powering up, some anime waifus dancing and above all this a text that says "Get in shape, loser" or "Solve those Leetcode hards sucker" or "You got this player, get to work before I snap your neck" maybe from Makima or Tsunade or some shit. IDK. Shit has to be powerful and relatable, especially for zoomers. Maybe even some tiktoks. 
- HBO's succession will sell like hot buns. Exploit that shit.
