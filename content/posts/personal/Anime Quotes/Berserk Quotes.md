>*Griffith: Martyrdom for a merciless God. What a waste. On the battlefield the life of a common soldier isn't worth even a single silver piece. In today's world, most people's life are subject to the whims of the nobility and the royalty. Of course, even a king can't live exactly as he pleases. We are all at the mercy of the great tide and we will disappear in the end. Our lives spent never even knowing who we were. In life, unrelated to one's social standing or class as determined by man, there are some people who, by nature are keys that set the world in motion. They are the true elite as dictated by the Golden Rule of the Universe. That is what I want to know. What is my place in the world? Who am I? What am I capable of? What am I destined for?*

>*Griffith: While many can pursue their dreams in solitude, other dreams are like great storms blowing hundreds, even thousands of dreams apart in their wake. Dreams breathe life into men and can cage them in suffering. Men live and die by their dreams. But long after they have been abandoned they still smolder deep in men's hearts. Some see nothing more than life and death. They are dead, for they have no dreams.*

>*Slan: How delightful. I feel it all over again. Love, hate, ultimate pleasure, ultimate pain, life, death, all here to enjoy, right before our very eyes! The true nature of man and the devil is here and now.*

>*Conrad: Without doubt, you stepped over the thousands of dead, whose bodies made up the stones to pave your way, and they, for you, have done the same to those before!*

>*Ubik: No illusion; we're merely holding a mirror to your own consciousness and allowing you to witness the reflection. You yourself stacked the cobblestones to reach the castle in the sky. That was and always has been your destiny.*

>*Narrator: Dreams. Each man longs to pursue his dream. Each man is tortured by this dream, but the dream gives meaning to his life. Even if the dream ruins his life, man cannot allow himself to leave it behind. In this world, is man ever able to possess anything more solid, than a dream?*

>*Griffith: (after receiving a vision pertaining to his childhood dream of ruling a castle) Was that...an illusion?*

>*Guts: You’re going to be alright. You just stumbled over a stone in the road, it means nothing. Your goal lies far beyond this, doesn’t it? I’m sure you’ll overcome this. You’ll walk again, soon.*

>*Void: You are our prodigy, our newest kinsman, our wing of darkness; Arise, Femto.*

>*Griffith: Do you think me a dreadful man? I had you take such a part in my affairs, while never getting my own hands dirty. I left the most difficult and dangerous tasks to you alone. Do you then not, resent me?*

>*Narrator: In this world, is the destiny of mankind controlled by some transcendental entity or law? Is it like the hand of God hovering above? At least it is true that man has no control; even over his own will.*

>*Guts: You do realize you're talking to the man who slaughtered a hundred men. I think it makes your question kind of pointless.*

>*Casca: Like a bonfire of dreams.*

>*Guts: It seems to me that everybody stakes their lives in a lost cause. Looking over them all from up here, I almost think I can see their hopes and dreams flickering in each little light.*

>*I am a portent of doom. The remnant of a grudge. My aim is ever singular. I have not the heart to bathe in the lambency of my mortal days.*

>*If I have to worry about the ants I crush beneath my feet, I couldn't even walk around.*

>*That thing was too big to be called a sword. Too big, too thick, too heavy, and too rough, it was more like a large hunk of iron.*
