Stratosphere, the 1998 slowcore classic by Duster, is a sonic force to be reckoned with. From the minimalist album cover to the dreamy soundscapes, this album evokes a sense of tranquility and longing that is both nostalgic and futuristic. The songs are slow and atmospheric, each one feeling like a journey through space and time, with recurring beats and tempo changes that keep things interesting.

The album's structure is unorthodox and unconventional, with songs flowing into each other seamlessly, creating a hypnotic effect that is both meditative and transportive. The lyrics, which are few and far between, are shrouded in a drony static noise that adds to the ethereal quality of the music. The muted vocals blend in perfectly with the lush instrumentation, creating a haunting, otherworldly atmosphere that is hard to resist.

Duster's Stratosphere is a true masterpiece of the slowcore genre, with each song exuding a calm and serene ambiance that is both soothing and introspective. The music feels like a cosmic hug, enveloping the listener in a warm and comforting embrace. It's hard not to get lost in the dreamy soundscapes and the nostalgic mood of the album.

The album is a testament to the power of minimalism, with its stripped-down instrumentation and sparse lyrics creating a sense of space and openness that is rare in modern music. The songs are simple yet complex, with layers of sound that reveal themselves upon repeated listens. The album's beauty lies in its simplicity, with each note and chord serving a purpose in the greater scheme of things.

The standout tracks on the album include "Constellations," a slow and introspective track that evokes a sense of longing and yearning; "Gold Dust," a hypnotic and repetitive song that builds slowly, like a wave crashing on the shore; and "Inside Out," a catchy and upbeat track that showcases Duster's ability to craft poppy melodies within a slowcore framework. I've replayed these songs countless times, and they never fail to put a smile on my face.

Overall, Duster's Stratosphere is a must-listen for fans of slowcore and ambient music. It's a mesmerizing and transportive experience that will leave you feeling relaxed and contemplative. This album is perfect for those moments when you need to escape the chaos of the world and retreat into your own personal space. It's a timeless classic that deserves to be heard by anyone who loves music that is both beautiful and contemplative.

**Rating: 8/10**
