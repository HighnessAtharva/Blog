**Rating:** 3.5/5 ⭐

The Gardens of the Moon, the first volume of the Malazan Book of the Fallen, is a sprawling epic fantasy of monumental proportions. The vast array of characters is not just diverse, but uniquely and exquisitely crafted, and each of their roles is pivotal to the story's advancement. There are no throwaway scenes or chapters; every dialogue and action ripples and reverberates throughout the intricate narrative, creating a vivid tapestry of political intrigue, mystical manipulation, and fantastical landscapes.

Upon embarking on the Malazan Book of the Fallen Vol 1 - "Gardens of the Moon," I was initially intimidated by its sheer scope, as many fellow online enthusiasts had warned me of its formidable length. Having already delved into the intricate worlds of ASoIaF, WoT, Tchaikovsky's works, Mistborn, and the First Law Trilogy, I felt confident in my fantasy reading prowess. However, my apprehension soon dissipated upon immersing myself into the first few chapters of the novel, and I quickly realized that my fears were unfounded.

The book's incredible length may be daunting, but its enthralling tale draws the reader in, and the full-blown battles in are a breathtaking display of military expertise fantasy elements.

Malazan is a book series that delves deeply into war and conflict. The story is centered around an ambitious empire led by Emperor Kellanved, whose ultimate goal is to dominate the world. The book opens with a siege of Malaz City, one of the key cities in the continent of Genabackis, where we are introduced to several key characters, including Paran, a young nobleman with dreams of becoming a soldier.

As the Emperor’s troops sack the city, Paran witnesses the rise of Laseen, the commander of the Emperor’s assassins known as the Claw. Fast forward almost a decade later, and Laseen has taken over as the new Empress, laying siege to Pale, one of the last free cities in Genabakis. Anomander Rake, the powerful and mysterious ruler of the floating fortress Moon’s Spawn, is the only thing keeping the city from falling to the empire.

Paran has finally achieved his dream of becoming a lieutenant in the Emperor’s army but quickly becomes entangled in investigating a strange troop massacre that doesn't appear to have been part of any battle. The new Empress sends her second-in-command, the Adjunct Lorn, to investigate the incident.

Paran ends up working for Lorn and finds himself getting much more than just a promotion. Meanwhile, a young woman named Sorry is taken by powerful forces and becomes an unstoppable killing machine, now part of the Bridgeburners, a troop of elite soldiers in the Emperor’s army.

Whiskeyjack, a Bridgeburner and now a sergeant, is nominally in command of all the soldiers and participates in the siege of Pale. Despite their best efforts, the empire suffers heavy casualties during the siege, beset by both internal and external enemies.

The crazed Mage Hairlock is plotting against the Bridgeburners, Dujek, and Tattersail, and the Empire operatives are playing both sides as they try to accomplish their mission while staying alive and one step ahead of the Empress and her allies. But when the Bridgeburners are assigned to undermine the last free city of Darujhistan, they are drawn into a web of intrigue involving assassins, thieves, double-dealing elites, and other shady figures, all while competing gods and magical beings meddle in their affairs.

All of this takes place against the backdrop of an ancient malevolent power that has been awakened and threatens the entire continent.

The prose in "Gardens of the Moon" is truly magnificent, and Erikson's writing captures the epic scale and grandeur of the novel with exceptional flair. His words are elaborate and vivid, conveying a sense of awe-inspiring depth, especially during the backstory and philosophical moments. Conversely, in the heart-pounding action scenes, his writing is spare yet powerful, like a skilled craftsman at work. The seamless blending of these contrasting styles creates an incredible reading experience that left a lasting impression on me.

With a sprawling cast of characters, it can be challenging to keep track of everyone. However, I found it helpful to latch onto my favorite characters and their story arcs like liferafts in a sea of players. Throughout the novel, Erikson also weaves in historical figures from previous epochs, adding further depth to the story.

Despite the sheer number of characters, each one is incredibly well-drawn, with layers of nuance and complexity. My favorites included Paran, Tattersail, Ben, Rallick, Murillio, and Kruppe, each of whom left a lasting impression on me. Even the enigmatic and menacing Rake was captivating in his own right. What struck me most about these characters was their moral ambiguity. Few, if any, were wholly good or bad, with many caught in the grey area in between. Some were simply "doing their job," while others were trying to survive. But even those with a strong sense of morality, like Whiskeyjack, were part of an oppressive, expansionist empire, making it difficult to define anyone's actions as wholly good or evil.

Despite this moral ambiguity, the characters' struggles and conflicts brought out their best moments, showcasing their resilience and tenacity. It was fascinating to see how characters like Paran evolved and matured throughout the novel, rising to the occasion when faced with the darkest of situations.

The novel's themes of possession, manipulation, rebirth, and death are brilliantly woven into the plot, and the hounds add a fantastic otherworldly element to the tale. The prophecies, poems, and epigraphs preceding each chapter lend an air of heavy foreshadowing that only adds to the anticipation and excitement. The concept of meddling gods is one that always piques my interest, and "Gardens of the Moon" has plenty of it. The deities and sub-deities in this universe have competing agendas, some for pure amusement and others as puppet-masters manipulating events for their own gain. None of these deities are particularly likable, but the volatile nature of their involvement in the story makes for fascinating developments.

Erikson's book is dark and filled with battlefield gore, violence, torture, trauma, death (though dead is not always final, and it can also mean undead), lost love, and despair. Despite this, there are glimmers of hope throughout, and Erikson implies that despite their many flaws, beings are essentially good.

The book's personal courage is a central theme that struck a chord with me. It takes courage not only to stand up for one's ideals, but also to face overwhelming odds with bravery, knowing defeat is inevitable but standing up anyway. Mortals daring to face gods and superior magical forces and, although their success is rare, their tenacity and determination can surprisingly change the course of events.

However, the most significant theme in the book is the value placed on diverse cultures, races, and genders. The Malazan military machine is the most formidable armed force the world has ever seen, thanks to the diversity of its ranks. As they conquer and acquire more humans and non-humans, they seem to be effectively integrated into the military, utilizing all of their talents.

Moreover, the various races in the armed forces get along seamlessly, and there are no apparent racial or gender impediments to rising in rank. The empire appears to preserve cultural identity instead of wiping it out, not out of altruistic purposes, but rather for pragmatic ones. I will be watching this theme closely as I progress through the series to see if it holds true in future books.

The worldbuilding in "Gardens of the Moon" is stupendous. Erikson has fashioned an enormous and immersive universe, complete with military orders, sociology, anthropology, magic systems, mythology, history, languages, races, and everything else needed to make it seem entirely real. It is an incredible achievement rivalled by few other fantasy books, with hell hounds, demons, giant crows, shapeshifters, floating fortresses, and even dragons!

As someone who adores absorbing worldbuilding, I was overwhelmed by it for perhaps the first time while reading a fantasy book. However, I can only blame my own shortcomings rather than Erikson for the fact that I was sometimes deluged by the book's worldbuilding and labyrinthine plot. My advice to those new to Erikson's work is to relax and read without overthinking it. Although I found myself irked at times trying to comprehend everything I was reading, I learned to appreciate the story and writing without feeling the need to understand everything all at once.

I am captivated and eager to press on, and in a few days' time, I will commence my journey with "Deadhouse Gates". Expect a review of that book in the coming weeks.
