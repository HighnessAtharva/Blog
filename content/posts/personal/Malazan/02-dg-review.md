**Rating:** 4/5 ⭐  

After reading two books in the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, my impression of the writer's work has shifted slightly. While this book, Deadhouse Gates, connected with me on a character-driven level, its bleakness, plethora of new faces, and the desert setting made it slightly more confusing than the previous book, Gardens of the Moon.

Erikson, known for his world-building skills, takes the already extensive cast of characters and places and expands them even further, leaving little respite for readers who struggled to keep up with the first book. However, this book does improve on characterization compared to the previous one.

One significant difference from Gardens of the Moon is the portrayal of the Malazan Empire. While in the first book, the empire seemed almost unbeatable, in Deadhouse Gates, the opposite is true. Additionally, this book takes place in an entirely different location, the Seven Cities, and the heart of the empire, leaving behind the big players and settings of book one.

At first, leaving behind my favorite characters like Anomander Rake made me uneasy. However, a compelling prologue and meeting exciting new characters soon had me invested in the story. Although I still hope to learn the fate of the characters I grew to like in book one.

The story of Deadhouse Gates is framed by four distinct storylines that converge later in the novel.

To start off, Felisin Paran, the youngest sister of Ganoes, is in grave danger as a member of a noble house caught up in a carefully orchestrated culling of the Malazan Empire’s Seven Cities nobility. Empress Laseen, still trying to wipe out any of those who were loyal to the previous Emperor Kellanved and his main ally Dancer, is behind the plot, and her new right hand, Adjunct Tavore, is leading the culling of the elite. Tavore is Felisin's sister and has disavowed their family and former noble friends in favour of allegiance to the Empress. Felisin survives violent riots seeking the death of the former ruling class by teaming up with an excommunicated former High Priest of the war deity Fener named Heboric, and a strong-man named Baudin, but she is forced to associate with these two undesirable companions.

The novel also introduces Mappo, a huge Trell warrior, and his travelling companion, the mysterious Icarium, who is part Jaghut. These two long-lived beings, with legendary reputations as fighters, have an unbreakable bond, but Mappo is hiding things from his friend, and Icarium is suffering from memory loss. Shapeshifting beings called Soletaken and D’ivers are at war, trying to achieve Ascendency, and Mappo and Icarium find themselves taking refuge with an insane High Priest of Shadow, Iskaral Pust, who has his own plans for the two.

In another storyline, Dukier, an Imperial Historian, joins the 7th Malazan Army in the Seven Cities at the wrong time as revolution is imminent. A holy war called “The Whirlwind” has been prophesized to free denizens of the Empire from the tyrannical yoke of Laseen, and Sha’ik, prophetess of that Holy War, has whipped up her followers into a frenzy, convinced that they can overthrow their feudal masters. The seemingly indomitable Empire has never looked so vulnerable. Lassen has cleverly and brutally culled the nobility to placate the revolutionaries, but it’s not enough, and the Empress turns to the barbarian Wickan chieftain Coltaine, known as a redoubtable warlord who led a revolt against Lassen’s predecessor. Coltaine’s marching orders are to safeguard thousands of forlorn Malazan civilians en route to the imperial city of Aren in “The Chain of Dogs,” but there is little hope for such a forced march.

Finally, we return to four characters familiar to us the most, the gruff sapper Fiddler, the mysterious assassin Kalam, the former thief Crokus, and his lover Apsalar, who was once possessed by the will of a capricious god. Instead of getting Apsalar to her hometown, the diversion to Seven Cities is part of a precarious mission conceived by Kalam and Fiddler to assassinate the Empress. They believe that she is oppressing her citizens and conspired to kill the famous Bridgeburners military unit Kalam and Fiddler are part of.

The evolution of characterization in Steven Erikson's "Deadhouse Gates" is simply remarkable. The pivotal character, Felisin, is damaged and complex, possessing bitterness, self-loathing, and a penchant for cruelty towards those closest to her. Her motivations for revenge and self-preservation are entwined with drug addiction, yet she remains fiercely loyal, brave, determined, and cunning, making her an unforgettable, tragic figure. As readers bear witness to her struggles, they may find themselves both aghast and rooting for her redemption.

Coltaine, another compelling character, rises above societal elitism as a clever and ruthless underdog. In a time of war and turmoil, he saves countless innocent lives while confronting revolt among his own soldiers and an army seeking the annihilation of his people. Mappo and Icarium also captivate with their relationship, reminiscent of Dante and Virgil in "Divine Comedy," observing grand events beyond their control while navigating their own involvement in the action.

Themes in this book are bleak and harrowing, delving into the darkest aspects of humanity. The book tackles topics such as prostitution, attempted sexual assault, genocide, torture, war atrocities, fanaticism, betrayal, murder, madness, revenge, pettiness, emotional trauma, war, and its hefty costs. The brutality of these scenes may give pause to readers, yet they also serve to underscore the fortitude, bravery, and compassion of the characters who ultimately choose to kill only as a last resort to defend themselves and others.

While the world-building can at times be overwhelming, Erikson's prose has grown increasingly complex and contemporary, with beautifully descriptive passages and pronounced ironic and sardonic humor. The meddling gods and their sinister designs on mortals loom large in the book, with their creations and servants shaping the fate of those caught in their web of divine plots and intrigues.

The prose has evolved into a contemporary and complex form, featuring lengthy passages without dialogue, which is definitely not my cup of tea, I mean it isn't exactly a page-turner like Agatha Christie novels, is it? The abundance of lore, locations, characters, and world-building elements, while impressive in its complexity, can be overwhelming and mentally taxing. Nonetheless, the author's ironic and sardonic humor is more pronounced than ever, adding to the book's charm and uniqueness.

The worldbuilding in this book is exceptional, rivaling the likes of Stephen King, George R.R. Martin, and Joe Abercrombie in its intricacy and depth. It is comprehensive and elaborate to a degree rarely seen, with an array of magic warrens, shapeshifters, gods and demons, as well as numerous races, cultures, histories, traditions, and customs. While it can be daunting to take it all in, it's a true testament to the author's genius. To fully enjoy the book, it's best not to get bogged down in the details, but rather let it enrich the experience.

The book features both large-scale battles and smaller conflicts, and the fight scenes are nothing short of magnificent. The author captures the gruesomeness, heartbreak, and glory of a military campaign with incredible detail. With an immense character list and multiple character arcs, the author strives to flesh out most of his characters to the point where they feel optimally realized. His vision for the world is staggering in scope and imagery, while remaining intimate and tangible.

The author tackles a complex plot, but manages to keep it enthralling and moving forward cohesively. The impactful prose holds the reader's interest for nearly a thousand pages, which is no small feat. While there may be moments where the author falls short, it's under the weight of the complicated backstory, twisty plot, and vast cast of players. However, the author's uncompromising and meticulous approach to creating something grand and delivering on it to a large extent is nothing short of brilliant.

This book is a tome, dense and laborious to read, but worth every page. It's a magnificent novel that demands mental exertion from the reader, but the payoff is immense. Despite the challenges, the reader will be compelled to continue the Malazan series, eager to uncover more of the Imperial developments. With "Memories of Ice" awaiting, the reader anticipates completing the epic saga before the end of 2023 and looks back on this journey with gratitude for having undertaken it.
