>*Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. Everybody’s gonna die. Come watch TV?*

>*Think for yourselves. Don’t be sheep.*

>*What, so everyone’s supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?*

>*Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.*

>*You’re the little brother. You’re not the cause of your parents’ misery, you’re just a symptom of it.*

>*Get out of here, Summer! You ruined the season 4 premiere!*

>*Weddings are basically just funerals with cake.*

>*Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call love is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science.*

>*This seems like a good time for a drink and a cold calculated speech with sinister overtones, a speech about politics, about order, brotherhood, power. But speeches are for campaigning. Now is the time for action.*

>*The universe is basically an animal. It grazes on the ordinary. It creates infinite idiots just to eat them*

>*Tell you how to feel about school. It’s a waste of time. A bunch of people runnin’ around bumpin’ into each other. There’s a guy up front that says “2 plus 2” and the people in the back say four. The bell rings and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. School’s not a place for smart people. It’s not a popular opinion, but that’s my two cents worth.*

>*Honey, stop raising your father’s cholesterol so you can take a hot funeral selfie.*
