>*BoJack : He’s so stupid he doesn’t realize how miserable he should be.*

>*BoJack : Settle. Because otherwise you’re just gonna get older and harder, and more alone. And you’re gonna do everything you can to fill that hole, with friends, and your career, and meaningless sex, but the hole doesn’t get filled. One day, you’re gonna look around and you’re going to realize that everybody loves you, but nobody likes you. And that is the loneliest feeling in the world.*

>*It gets easier. Every day it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it every day —that’s the hard part. But it does get easier*

>*Mr. Peanutbutter : Crack an egg on your head. Let the yolk drip down.*

>*BoJack : You are a horrible person, and you not understanding that you’re a horrible person, doesn’t make you less of a horrible person.*

>*BoJack : I feel like my life is just a series of unrelated wacky adventure*

>*Secretariat: BoJack, when I was your age, I got sad. A lot. I didn’t come from such a great home, but one day, I started running, and that seemed to make sense, so then I just kept running. BoJack, when you get sad, you run straight ahead and you keep running forward, no matter what. There are people in your life who are gonna try to hold you back, slow you down, but you don’t let them. Don’t you stop running and don’t you ever look behind you. There’s nothing for you behind you. All that exists is what’s ahead.

>*Princess Carolyn: So, are you available for Tuesday, or are you gonna be too busy masturbating to old pictures of yourself*

>*BoJack : your girlfriend has a stripper name*

>*Mr. Peanutbutter: Sweetie, you know I support you, whatever you want to do, but you’re not gonna find what you’re looking for in these awful made-up places. The universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to being happy isn’t a search for meaning. It’s to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you’ll be dead.*
