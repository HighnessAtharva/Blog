Amidst the whirlwind of academic and professional commitments, I managed to carve out precious moments to immerse myself in the magic of cinema. The month of May brought forth an array of highly anticipated films, and while my movie-watching endeavors were limited, the experiences I had were truly captivating. This is partly to blame on TV shows like Better Call Saul which I recently finished and Succession which I just picked up and have been obsessively binge watching. But hey, this blog is about movies! Brace yourselves as I take you on a thrilling journey through some of the cinematic gems that left an indelible mark on my imagination.

Prepare to be on the edge of your seat as John Wick returns in "Chapter 4," delivering a nerve-wracking action experience that rivals the intensity of a superhero movie. This latest installment of the franchise takes the already high-octane action to new heights, surpassing its predecessors in a relentless onslaught of jaw-dropping sequences.From the very beginning, the film catapults you into a world where combat reigns supreme. John Wick, portrayed by the enigmatic Keanu Reeves, is once again the unstoppable force we've come to know and admire. Armed with his signature blend of precise gunplay and lethal hand-to-hand combat, Wick embarks on a blood-soaked journey that defies all logic and leaves you breathless. Nun chucks face blasts were a godsend!The action sequences in here are a mind-boggling spectacle, pushing the boundaries of what seems humanly possible. Wick's encounters with armored samurais, biker gangs, and the relentless High Table assassins are nothing short of astonishing. Director Chad Stahelski orchestrates each fight with impeccable precision, weaving together a symphony of violence that is both visually stunning and emotionally engaging.While the film boasts an impressive array of cool side characters and a satisfying ending, it falls slightly short of perfection due to a juvenile villain and an overly grandiose plot. However, these minor flaws are easily overshadowed by the sheer adrenaline rush provided by the relentless action."John Wick: Chapter 4" cements itself as one of the best franchises of our time, delivering a captivating blend of stylized violence, complex choreography, and intense storytelling. It's a rollercoaster ride of non-stop excitement that will leave you both exhilarated and craving for more. Buckle up and brace yourself for an extraordinary cinematic experience.

## Evil Dead Rise, 2023 - ★★★

![Evil Dead Rise, 2023 - ★★★](https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/3/6/7/6/1/636761-evil-dead-rise-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=51a7fe0b29)

**Review**

Evil Dead Rise, the latest installment in the Evil Dead franchise, is a blood-soaked extravaganza that delivers on the gore and the screams, but falls short in other aspects. This movie is a mixed bag of hilarious try-hard scares, mediocre acting, lazy writing and disappointing character development.Despite its flaws, Evil Dead Rise succeeds in creating a truly unhinged and violent atmosphere that is sure to leave horror fans satisfied. The variety of kills, jump scares, lighting, weapons, and visual effects are impressive, making for a thrilling and visually stunning experience.However, the movie's weak points are hard to overlook. The dialogue is often shoddy and lazy, and the characters are uninteresting, making it difficult to feel connected to their plight. At times, the violence and gore become so excessive that they border on juvenile, taking away from the overall horror experience.Overall, Evil Dead Rise is a good and entertaining watch for horror fans looking for a flesh extravaganza. While it falls short in some aspects, the movie's sheer brutality and stunning visual effects make for a worthwhile experience.

**Review**

Listen up, fantasy nerds! We've finally got an entertaining Dungeons & Dragons movie on our hands! "Honor Among Thieves" doesn't suck ass like the last few attempts at bringing our beloved world to the big screen. This movie is wholly entertaining, meta, and self-aware. It's like the filmmakers knew they had a lot to make up for, and they nailed it!The casting was on point, with each actor perfectly fitting their role. The VFX may have some rough spots, but it's hard not to laugh when the levitation, summoning, and extreme expression-driven acting come into play. It's all intentional, trust me.The lore and world-building is rich and deep, as one would expect from Dungeons & Dragons. And let's talk about the action sequences - they're a delight! The comedy is on point, and the "magic" aspect of it all is captivating. The movie is light-hearted and inventive, and the camera work and editing are pretty great.Overall, "Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves" is a thieving delight! It's definitely worth watching, especially for the fantasy nerds out there
