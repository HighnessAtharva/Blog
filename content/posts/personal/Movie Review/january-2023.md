January 2023 brought a plethora of cinematic experiences my way, and I'm eager to share my take on them. From classic films to new releases, my viewing journey was diverse and exciting. This month I tackled a few movies that have been on my watchlist for a while, and I'm glad I finally got around to watching them. I enjoyed "The Menu" and "Moonrise Kingdom," but I was disappointed by "To Die For." I also watched a comedy special, and I was blown away by "Andrew Schulz: Infamous." It's one of the best comedy specials I've seen in a long time. Get your popcorn ready, because it's time to dive into my January 2023 movie reviews!

## To Die For, 1995 - ★★½

**Review**

 "To Die For" starring Nicole Kidman is a movie that's almost as convoluted as its title. Kidman's portrayal of the narcissistic Suzanne Stone is the only thing that saves this film from total disaster. Her charm and magnetic personality are so enthralling that you almost forget that the plot makes little to no sense.The movie follows the life of a newlywed bride who befriends three teens and convinces them to murder her husband so she can gain media attention and hopefully land a big network deal. It's like a twisted version of "Mean Girls," but with more murder and less pink.While the movie tries to be a dark comedy, it falls short on both counts. The humor is forced, and the drama is too over-the-top to be taken seriously. The only thing that really works in "To Die For" is Kidman's performance.Overall, "To Die For" is a forgettable film that tries too hard to be edgy and ends up feeling like a bad soap opera. If you're a fan of crime comedies, you might get some enjoyment out of it, but don't expect anything groundbreaking. It's like "Gone Girl," but without the suspense or the thrill.

**Review**

 "Andrew Schulz: Infamous" is one of the best standup comedy specials in the modern era. Schulz's unapologetic and unhinged style reminds me of Daniel Sloss, but with even more edge and attitude. He's like a bulldozer, mowing down any sensitive snowflakes that dare to get in his way.Schulz's stage presence and delivery are top-notch, and he doesn't hold back when it comes to his material. From start to finish, there's a nonstop barrage of jokes that feel improvised and natural, as if he's just riffing off the top of his head.One of the best things about "Infamous" is how accurately Schulz portrays the current state of our society. He slays woke people right in their faces and makes them look stupid, which is both hilarious and refreshing. It's a reminder that sometimes you need to take a step back and laugh at how ridiculous things have become.Overall, "Andrew Schulz: Infamous" is a must-watch for anyone who loves standup comedy. It's edgy, unapologetic, and incredibly accurate. Schulz is a true master of his craft, and this special is a testament to his skills. Don't miss out on this one!

## Bio Hunter, 1995 - ★★★

**Review**

 "Bio Hunter" is a strange and twisted movie that blends neo-noir crime, political thriller, and body horror into a bizarre but somehow enjoyable mix. I don't remember much about the movie, but that's probably because I watched it way past midnight and might have hallucinated some of the more gruesome scenes.The movie is definitely not for the faint of heart, as there's a lot of blood and guts on display. But if you're a fan of body horror, then you'll probably enjoy the twisted visuals and grotesque special effects.Despite the strange mix of genres, "Bio Hunter" somehow manages to work, and it kept me engaged throughout. The political thriller elements added some depth to the story, while the neo-noir crime aspects gave it a gritty, noirish feel.Overall, "Bio Hunter" is a weird and wild ride that's worth checking out if you're a fan of horror movies. Just be prepared for a lot of blood and guts, and maybe don't watch it too late at night if you're prone to hallucinations.

## Wicked City, 1987 - ★★★½

**Review**

 "Wicked City" is a cool, neo-noir anime movie that's a great addition to any collection. The movie nails the vibe and atmosphere of the old retro anime movies, with its dark color palette and dreamy, futuristic cityscape.The characters are memorable and well-designed, and the creature design is raw and rough, adding to the movie's gritty and gory feel. Some scenes are downright vile, but that just adds to the movie's overall appeal.Despite the dark and gritty tone, "Wicked City" has a dash of romance and action that keeps things interesting. And if you're a fan of dubbed anime, you'll be happy to know that the dialogues and audio are top-notch.One of my favorite things about "Wicked City" is the ending credit song, which is catchy and memorable. It's a great way to cap off an enjoyable movie.Overall, "Wicked City" is a must-watch for any anime fan, especially those who love neo-noir and dark, gritty stories. It's a great example of how anime can be both beautiful and gruesome at the same time.

## Bullet Train, 2022 - ★★★½
  
![Bullet Train, 2022 - ★★★½](https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/4/1/9/6/1/641961-bullet-train-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=9245faa1ba)

**Watched on**: 09 January 2023

**Review**

 "Bullet Train" is like a crazy mix of Snatch, Kill Bill, John Wick, and Murder on the Orient Express, all rolled into one highly entertaining action-comedy! It's a bit outrageous and not meant to be taken too seriously, but that's part of what makes it so much fun.The movie is filled with plenty of funny and memorable characters and moments, and the visuals and cinematography are soaked in a beautiful neon glow that really adds to the movie's overall style. The action is awesome, well-shot, and brutal, which is no surprise coming from the guy who helped create John Wick and directed Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2, and Hobbs and Shaw!One unique thing about "Bullet Train" is that every character gets a few minutes of introduction, which breaks the flow of the story a bit, but it's also quite funny. By the end of the movie, even a water bottle gets a title sequence and backstory!While "Bullet Train" isn't a constant stream of one-liners, the situational and compositional comedy really works, and it won't age out of its comedy in the same way that movies with pop culture references may.Overall, if you're looking for an action-packed, visually stunning, and highly entertaining movie, then "Bullet Train" is definitely worth a watch. It's a wild ride that's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat!

**Review**

 It's the story of a girl trying to get rid of her bothersome virginity, and the annoying assortment of boys who help and hinder her in her quest.... plus a long and disgusting lecture from her father after she dares to ask her mother about the subject. This is worth an award, even if it came with a parental warning for anyone who didn't see the title. A seductive and more adult themed short than most the ones nominated! Incredible colors, engaging, youthful, and well made! This short is focused on wanting to lose her virginity which is interesting and provocative. Seems like a weird one to be award worthy yet awesome and respectable how the main woman realizes to reject the necessary jerks.Plenty of cool moments, cute, charming, and romantic; well deserving of praise this is wonderful adult themed short.

 This movie is a feast for the eyes and the mind! With Anya Taylor-Joy's impeccable acting, the attention to detail, and the exquisite camera work, The Menu is a masterpiece that deserves to be savored.The movie is set in a restaurant that caters to the richest and the most eccentric people, and it is an absolute thrill to watch the characters interact and the plot twists unfold. The film's fine craftsmanship is evident in the microscopic details and the twists and turns that happen so often, you won't even have time to finish your popcorn!The dialogue is cleverly written, and the characters are well fleshed out, making you care about their fates as much as the chef's meticulously prepared courses. You'll find yourself transported to the restaurant, feeling as if you are part of the party of messed-up rich people.All in all, The Menu is a must-see movie that is sure to leave you exhilarated, with the "burger" scene being one of the highlights. So put on your fancy pants and get ready to indulge in this delightful culinary experience!

**Review**

 Moonrise Kingdom, a sweet and touching film by Wes Anderson, will transport you back to the summer of 1965, where love and adventure are just a bike ride away. This quirky love story of two 12-year-olds, Sam and Suzy, is beautifully crafted and executed with Anderson's signature style of meticulous set design and bright primary colors. The film is a celebration of youthful imagination and the innocence of young love, reminding us of a time when the world was full of possibilities and magic was just around the corner.Anderson's inspiration from Rohal Dahl's style is evident, as the film's hyper-real world is not quite fantasy but filled with small bizarre details. The characters are all quirky, yet lovable, and their oddities add to the charm of the story. The film is well-acted, and the chemistry between the two young leads is palpable, making it easy to root for their star-crossed romance.Overall, Moonrise Kingdom is a must-watch for anyone who has experienced the pangs of young love or misses the boundless imagination of childhood. A touching and funny film that will leave you feeling warm and fuzzy inside.
