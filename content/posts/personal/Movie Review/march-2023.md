Lights, camera, action! March 2023 was a month filled with movie magic, and I had the pleasure of watching some truly amazing films. From thought-provoking dramas to side-splitting comedies, this month had it all. I'm excited to share my thoughts on the movies I watched, which include the morally challenging First Reformed, the hilarious Game Night, the emotionally charged Spencer, and the classic Edward Scissorhands. I also delved into some cult classics, such as the offbeat Buffalo '66 and the spooky Creepshow. I also managed to watch all the Scream sequels, which were a lot of fun. Ghostface killah baby! Woodsboro gang for life! And let's not forget the amazing live performance by The Weeknd at SoFi Stadium, which left me in awe. So grab some popcorn and join me as I take you through my movie journey of March 2023.

## Scream, 2022 - ★★½

![Scream, 2022 - ★★½](https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/7/2/1/1/9/572119-scream-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=9dc682121f)

**Review**

 "Scream 5" - the franchise loses its scream! The fifth installment in the "Scream" franchise brings back the surviving characters from the previous films once again, this time investigating a new series of murders.While it's nice to see the old characters back in action, their age is starting to show, and the movie struggles to recapture the magic of the original films. The new characters, while entertaining, are not quite as memorable as their predecessors, and the dialogues are often cheesy and self-aware to a fault.The movie also suffers from some editing issues, with certain scenes feeling disjointed and rushed. The pacing is a bit off, and the film never quite manages to build the same level of suspense as the earlier entries in the franchise.That being said, the mystery of the killer's identity is still engaging, and the reveal is satisfying. The movie does a good job of keeping the audience guessing until the very end.Overall, "Scream 5" is a decent enough horror movie, but it falls short of the high standards set by the earlier films in the franchise. While the mystery is engaging, the characters are showing their age, and the dialogues and editing issues detract from the overall experience. I'd give it a 2.5 out of 5 stars, with a recommendation to diehard fans of the franchise who are looking for closure.

**Review**

 Time for a soft reboot. the series gets a reboot! This fourth installment in the "Scream" franchise takes place ten years after the events of the previous film and introduces a new generation of characters.The movie attempts to update the franchise for a modern audience, with references to social media and internet culture. While this soft reboot approach can be hit or miss, "Scream 4" manages to blend the old and the new fairly well. The film is able to capture the essence of the original while still feeling fresh.However, one thing that does detract from the film is the coloring and lighting. The movie's bright and colorful aesthetic doesn't quite match the darker, grittier style of the first three films. While this can be seen as an attempt to modernize the franchise, it does take away from the signature "Scream" style.As for the characters, the new additions are mostly enjoyable, with a standout performance from Emma Roberts as Jill. The returning characters are also a welcome presence, with their chemistry and banter still as enjoyable as ever.The identity of the killer is once again a mystery, with the movie doing a good job of keeping the audience guessing. The reveal is satisfying, with a few twists and turns that keep things interesting.Overall, "Scream 4" is a decent addition to the franchise. While the bright and colorful aesthetic may not be for everyone, the movie does a good job of blending the old and the new. Fans of the franchise will enjoy the return of their favorite characters, and the new additions bring their own unique flavor to the mix.

## Scream 3, 2000 - ★★★

![Scream 3, 2000 - ★★★](https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/4/5/3/49453-scream-3-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=7ba5075018)

**Review**

 The third installment in the "Scream" franchise brings back the surviving characters from the previous films as they are once again targeted by a new killer in a Ghostface mask.While the film does have its share of suspense and scares, it falls short in comparison to its predecessors. The plot is a bit convoluted and doesn't quite pack the same punch as the first two movies. The characters, while still entertaining, don't have the same level of depth as they did in previous films.One thing that does work well in this movie is the exploration of the idea of trilogies, with the characters reflecting on the concept and its impact on the horror genre. However, this theme doesn't quite make up for the film's shortcomings in other areas.As for the identity of the killer, it doesn't quite live up to the mystery and suspense of the first two films. The reveal is a bit underwhelming, and the motivations behind the killings feel a bit contrived. Still, an essential scream movie. Goes without saying.

## Scream 2, 1997 - ★★★½

![Scream 2, 1997 - ★★★½](https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/ju/sr/4r/t3/c5AyWNWooMGkJXlqLwmPQCjUwHt-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=b19f368866)

**Review**

 One thing that sets the "Scream" franchise apart from other horror movies is its self-awareness and willingness to poke fun at horror movie tropes. "Scream 2" is no exception, with characters often referencing horror movies and their clichés, adding a layer of humor to the film.As for the identity of the Ghostface killer, the movie does a great job of keeping the audience guessing until the end. The revelation is a bit of a shocker, with the killer's motivations being revealed in a dramatic twist. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but I will say that it's a satisfying conclusion to the film.Overall, "Scream 2" is a great example of a self-aware horror movie that both scares and entertains. It's a solid sequel that manages to capture the essence of the original while adding its own unique spin. If you're a fan of horror movies or just looking for a good scare, "Scream 2" is definitely worth checking out."Scream 2" - the sequel that slays! This horror flick from the late 90s is a scream-fest that will have you jumping out of your seat. With its fair share of twists and turns, "Scream 2" manages to keep the audience on the edge of their seats until the very end.The film picks up with Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) trying to move on from the horrors of the first film, only to find herself targeted yet again by a new killer in a Ghostface mask. With the help of her friends and a few new characters, Sidney must once again outsmart the killer and survive the night.One thing that stands out in "Scream 2" is the impressive makeup and special effects, which truly bring the horror to life. The characters are also well-developed, with each one bringing a unique personality to the screen. However, the movie does fall into some clichés that are common in the horror genre, which may disappoint some viewers.Overall, "Scream 2" is a worthy follow-up to the original film, with plenty of suspense and scares to keep horror fans entertained. While it may not reinvent the wheel, it certainly delivers on the thrills and spills.

## First Reformed, 2017 - ★★★

![First Reformed, 2017 - ★★★](https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/25/z1/3z/xn/8HKA3Hwf8jQWy8TCYWr7C8Wft23-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=79051e4cf2)

**Watched on**: 14 March 2023

**Review**

First Reformed is a thought-provoking film that challenges the viewer's moral code. Set in a picturesque countryside, the idyllic scenery is juxtaposed with the protagonist's inner turmoil, creating an atmosphere that is both serene and unsettling. Ethan Hawke delivers a meditative and stoic performance that captivates the audience, drawing them into the character's conflicted mind.The cinematography and aspect ratio were on point, and there were some truly memorable shots throughout the film. The use of the aspect ratio to create a sense of claustrophobia and confinement was particularly effective, heightening the tension and drama of the story.However, the final hour of the film felt a bit stretched and lackluster, with some questionable decisions made by the protagonist that left me feeling a bit disappointed. The pacing slowed down, and it didn't quite have the same impact as the earlier parts of the movie.That being said, the screenplay and quotes were strong, and the film does leave a lasting impression. It's a good watch, but not the most memorable one out there.

## Game Night, 2018 - ★★★½

![Game Night, 2018 - ★★★½](https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/7/8/0/4/8/378048-game-night-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=7216b8d79c)

**Watched on**: 12 March 2023

**Review**

Game Night is like the ultimate game night with your coolest friends. And let's be real - Rachel McAdams is like my dream girlfriend after this movie.The quotes are on point, the funniest scenes will have you in stitches, and the puns are just chef's kiss. Plus, there are so many references for moviegoers and cinema enthusiasts that you'll be like, 'Okay, I see what you did there.'And the twists and turns? Don't even get me started. This movie is jam-packed with action, and it's just so much fun to watch.Witty, charming, and sexy - this movie has it all. I seriously have no complaints. Game Night is just an all-around good time, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good laugh.

## Buffalo '66, 1998 - ★★★★

![Buffalo '66, 1998 - ★★★★](https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/eo/sj/w9/xl/taVFuUhUWoX9YE7bb2bWkSPjC9P-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=94ae22e6f8)

**Watched on**: 11 March 2023

**Review**

Buffalo '66? More like Buffalo 'hits ya right in the feels'! This flick is the definition of self-aware, with enough meta moments to make your head spin. The acting? Un-freakin'-real. And don't even get me started on the meme potential. #Buffalo66Challenge, anyone?But seriously, this movie's got it all - it's culturally relevant, packed with pop culture references, and visually stunning. The photography and camera work will have you saying 'Wow, this is art, not just a movie!'But be warned, it's emotionally charged and raw, so bring some tissues if you're a crier. The wordplay is also on point, with engaging scenes that will hook you in from start to finish.Overall, Buffalo '66 may not be perfect, but it's definitely worth a watch. Just make sure you're ready to experience some serious feelings.

## Spencer, 2021 - ★★★½

![Spencer, 2021 - ★★★½](https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/3/9/5/5/9/639559-spencer-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=33938ea371)

**Watched on**: 11 March 2023

**Review**

Spencer is like a peek into the life of a royal gone rogue. And let's be real - who doesn't love a good British accent? The mansions and set designs are out of this world, and the costumes are just chef's kiss.The emotional drama is palpable, with plenty of melancholic moments that will leave you with a lingering sense of sadness. But hey, that's what makes it so beautiful, right? And the landmarks and set pieces are shot so freaking well, you'll be like 'Wow, I need to visit England ASAP.'And of course, we can't forget about Kristen Stewart's acting. She does a great job of capturing the essence of a royally depressed person throwing on a good show.Overall, if you're a fan of moody dramas and royals gone rogue, Spencer is definitely worth a watch. Just make sure you have some tissues handy.

## Edward Scissorhands, 1990 - ★★★½

**Watched on**: 10 March 2023

**Review**

Edward Scissorhands is like the Tim Burton movie to end all Tim Burton movies. Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder are iconic in this flick, and the setting and worldbuilding are out of this world. It's like Napoleon Dynamite meets the Stanley Kubrick alternate universe.The set design is on point too - it's like every detail was carefully crafted to make you feel like you're in a totally different world. Plus, there are some seriously heartfelt moments that will hit you right in the feels.But let's be real - this movie is also hella generic in some ways. But the self-awareness and meta commentary elevate it to a whole new level. It's like, yeah, we know this is kinda cheesy, but we're gonna own it anyway.Overall, Edward Scissorhands is a classic for a reason. If you haven't seen it yet, what are you even doing with your life?

## Promising Young Woman, 2020 - ★★★★

**Watched on**: 07 March 2023

**Review**

Promising Young Woman is like the ultimate power play between men and women. The drama is intense, the acting is on point, and the message is clear: don't mess with women, or you'll get what's coming to you.But let's be real - this movie is also a bit too preachy at times. But you know what? It works. It's like, yeah, we're gonna shove this message down your throat, and you're gonna like it.The style is super modern and stylish, which just adds to the overall badassery of the film. And the twisted, funny moments are just so potent. Plus, that ending? Holy sh*t. You'll never see it coming.Overall, Promising Young Woman is definitely worth a watch. Just be prepared for a rollercoaster of emotions and a powerful message about women and the sh*t we have to deal with.

**Watched on**: 07 March 2023

**Review**

Secretary, huh? This movie is definitely not your typical rom-com, that's for sure. It's raw, it's sensual, and it's...kinda weird, to be honest. But hey, that's what makes it so damn interesting.The alternative vibe is strong with this one, and the buildup will have you on the edge of your seat. Plus, there are some seriously funny moments that are actually supposed to be serious. You'll be like, 'Wait, am I supposed to laugh or...?'Overall, Secretary is a unique experience that's worth checking out if you're in the mood for something different. Just be prepared for some seriously kinky sh*t. Don't say I didn't warn you.

**Watched on**: 05 March 2023

**Review**

The Weeknd's concert had us feeling like we were part of the XO crew, with some sweet throwbacks and performances that had us grooving in our seats. The set design and visuals were lit AF, making us feel like we were at a party with The Weeknd himself. But let's be real, some of the vocals were a bit off-key, but we'll forgive him since he was singing live. There were tons of great moments that kept us entertained, but it's not a concert that we would consider "essential" to watch. Overall, if you're an XO fan, it's definitely worth checking out, but if you're not, you might want to skip this one.

## Primer, 2004 - ★★★★

**Watched on**: 04 March 2023

**Review**

Primer takes time travel to a whole new level, leaving me in a loop that I can't escape from. The non-traditional plot and low-vibrancy cinematography add to the indie feel of the film, making it stand out from the typical sci-fi blockbuster. The story is deep and intriguing, with layers upon layers that kept me guessing until the end. This is the kind of film that requires some serious brainpower to truly understand, but it's worth the effort. After watching the "Ending Explained" video on YouTube, I gained a whole new appreciation for the film and its intricate storyline. Primer is a good sci-fi mindfuck that will leave you wanting more. If you're a fan of time travel movies and don't mind a bit of a mental workout, then this is definitely one to add to your watchlist.

## Creepshow, 1982 - ★★★½

![Creepshow, 1982 - ★★★½](https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/n4/sm/so/1r/2oYLBnELBPbOKBQd9MKOqOmJ6aH-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=6140c7ccce)

**Watched on**: 04 March 2023

**Review**

Creepshow is a horror comedy film that's half serious and half a self-aware joke. The film is inspired by the horror comics of the 1950s, and it has that retro vintage feel to it, making it stand out from the typical horror film. Two of my favorite tales were "Something to Tide You Over" and "The Crate," both of which were haunting, creepy, and very comical and campy at the same time. The film offers a good assortment of tales that offer variety and keep the viewer engaged. The realistic visual effects and good dialogue add to the overall experience, making it feel like you're reading a comic book. While the film may not be for everyone, I would recommend watching it at least once for its unique take on horror and its ability to balance scares and humor. Overall, Creepshow is a decent horror comedy anthology that's worth checking out if you're a fan of the genre.
