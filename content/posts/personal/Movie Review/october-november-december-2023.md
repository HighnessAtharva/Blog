## The Nightmare Before Christmas, 1993 - ★★★★

**Review**

This stop-motion animated masterpiece, created by Tim Burton, showcases the magic of this unique art form. Jack Skellington, the King of Halloween Town, discovers Christmas and endeavours to put his own spooky spin on the holiday. The film's quirky blend of Halloween and Christmas themes, coupled with its well-fleshed-out characters, creates a delightful and memorable viewing experience. It does not look dated at all. I watched it for the first time 20 years after its initial release, and it still holds up. What sets this movie apart is its exceptional stop-motion animation, a rare and captivating choice that adds to its charm. Tim Burton's influence is evident in the visuals, creating the perfect Halloween ambience. However, it's the music that steals the show for me. Composed by Danny Elfman, who also lends his singing voice to Jack, the songs and score are the true highlights. While some songs are unforgettable, a few may fade from memory.Oogie Boogie, the film's villain, is a cool character, although I wish he had more screen time. Despite this, the movie is filled with creative ideas that make it a must-watch. Whether you're a fan of stop-motion animation, Tim Burton's unique style, or simply enjoy a quirky blend of Halloween and Christmas, "The Nightmare Before Christmas" promises an enchanting and musical journey worth experiencing.

## Murder on the Orient Express, 2017 - ★★½

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/x3/oo/kp/41/iBlfxlw8qwtUS0R8YjIU7JtM6LM-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=3e7799436b" width="300" alt="Murder on the Orient Express" class="left" >}}

**Watched on**: 29 December 2023

**Review**

This film promises a thrilling murder mystery experience. The plot revolves around the brilliant detective Hercule Poirot, who grapples with a murder case during a journey from Istanbul to Calais. As Poirot unravels a web of deceit, secrets, and conflicting motives among the eclectic ensemble of passengers, the film expertly builds tension and suspense, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats.While the execution of the plot is flawless, the Kenneth Branagh version faces criticism for various reasons. Overuse of CGI, alterations to character relationships and races, portraying Poirot as an unrealistic genius, a youthful portrayal of all characters, twists in the story creating loose ends, overdramatisation, and an overall lack of authenticity dampen the experience. The film deviates from the original material, using the name of a famous book for marketing purposes but altering key elements. Despite these shortcomings, Johnny Depp's performance stands out, though limited by the film's choices. The rapid resolution of mysteries diminishes suspense, leaving the film with mixed reviews.

## Saltburn, 2023 - ★★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/3/5/7/7/4/835774-saltburn-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=b58cbd3b08" width="300" alt="Saltburn" class="right" >}}

**Review**

 "Saltburn" emerges as a spectacularly crafted masterpiece, earning a solid 4/5. In this satirical exploration of wealth and extravagance, Emerald Fennell takes the helm with finesse, gradually peeling back layers of each character, creating a riveting narrative that keeps the audience glued to the unraveling chaos. The ensemble cast delivers one of the best performances of the year, with Rosamund Pike stealing the spotlight and Barry Keoghan fearlessly delivering his career-best. The film skillfully toes the line, presenting scenes that should be revolting but captivate through artistry in aesthetics, performances, and writing. The dark tone, coupled with an incredible score, sets the stage for a triumphant, mysterious, erotic, and hilarious satire—one of the best in years. Fennell's direction, as showcased in "Promising Young Woman," proves her prowess, making any future project a must-watch. The film promises Oscar nods for Production Design and Costume Design, with the ending dance scene and the revival of "Murder on the Dancefloor" adding a delightful touch. "Saltburn" stands as a unique, inventive, and weirdly enjoyable film, leaving cinephiles amazed and fulfilled. For diehard cinema lovers, this is a must-watch that promises satisfaction and reveals more with each rewatch.

## The Holy Mountain, 1973 - ★★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/7/8/0/5/47805-the-holy-mountain-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=d7002e900e" width="300" alt="The Holy Mountain" class="left" >}}

**Review**

 This weird, artsy/social commentary movie is a brilliant and intoxicating cinematic experience. Its beautiful, grotesque, and degenerate tableaus create a visual symphony that is both mesmerising and unique. The film carries monumental symbolism, with a simple truth underlying its theme, executed in a phenomenal way. Contrary to the style-versus-substance debate, "The Holy Mountain" seamlessly blends both into an unprecedented cinematic experience. It's messy, self-indulgent, and on the nose, yet that's precisely what adds to its beauty. The film, mirroring the artist's attempt to make eye-candy portrayals of cinema, delves into deep topics of spirituality and the occult. While it may not lead us to the holy mountain, the artist succeeds in crafting a weirdly artistic masterpiece. The explicitness, though at times unnecessary, doesn't overshadow the film's overall beauty. Watching it with commentary enhances the experience, doubling the fun and providing insights into the artist's intricate confusion and exploration.

## The Devil Wears Prada, 2006 - ★★★½

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/1/7/1/2/51712-the-devil-wears-prada-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=4a10e2c93f" width="300" alt="The Devil Wears Prada" class="right" >}}

**Review**

 In my mind, this chick-flick of sorts has positioned itself as the Wolf of Wall Street tailored for women, with Anne Hathaway portraying a refreshingly decent human being. Initially drawn by the brilliance of Meryl Streep, the film unfolds as a masterpiece, with Streep inventing a new standard of smug and swag as the upper-class fashionista boss. However, it's not just Streep who steals the show—Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt as the young P.As, showcase remarkable potential, elegantly embracing their roles. Blunt, in particular, embodies the struggles of an underrated personal assistant, subtly portraying the desperation and disappointment in her character. Hathaway undergoes a compelling character arc, transitioning from a regular girl to navigating the complexities of the fashion world. The performances are over the top, providing a deep insight into the fashion industry. A delightful comedy with satirical commentary, this film is a must-watch for connoisseurs of fine arts and drama, spotlighting standout performances from Streep, Blunt, and Hathaway.

## Killers of the Flower Moon, 2023 - ★★★½

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/9/8/0/0/9/398009-killers-of-the-flower-moon-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=49b577149d" width="300" alt="Killers of the Flower Moon" class="left" >}}

**Review**

 This was a memorable viewing experience, presenting a gripping tale of murders in the 1920s driven by the sinister motives of a white family aiming to steal oil rights from the Osage Nation. Martin Scorsese's passion for this tragic narrative is palpable, resulting in a powerful, albeit slow-paced, and at times, overlong cinematic experience. The film's darkness and violence are juxtaposed with outstanding performances, particularly from stalwarts Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, while Lily Gladstone steals the spotlight with a fantastic portrayal. The cinematography and score contribute to the movie's remarkable atmosphere. While the 3-hour 30-minute runtime left me slightly exhausted, the overall enjoyment persisted. Despite some pacing issues and a sense of underdeveloped Osage characters, the movie is a testament to Scorsese's directorial prowess, warranting a big-screen experience. While not my favourite from the director, I strongly recommend watching this complex narrative unfold. It tries to be too many things at once, but I like the visuals, the score and the set design, along with the rituals and processions of the Osage folks.

## The Killer, 2023 - ★★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/1/7/6/5/4/717654-the-killer-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=39fba8ec40" width="300" alt="The Killer" class="right" >}}

**Watched on**: 14 November 2023

**Review**

 The Killer was a joy to watch; it's a gripping experience I'd readily recommend. While the plot doesn't venture into unpredictable territory, the film captures the essence of shadowing a real contract killer, akin to the early Bourne movies. The main character's unique narration adds depth, creating tension even in mundane moments. The pacing maintains a constant sense of anticipation, seamlessly escalating into hyper-realistic, venomous action. Michael Fassbender and Tilda Swinton deliver outstanding performances, arguably some of their best, under David Fincher's masterful direction. Fincher's signature atmosphere, reminiscent of "The Game," permeates the film, marking it as an experimental yet impressive addition to his iconic filmography. Drawing parallels between Fincher and Wes Anderson as extreme perfectionists, This movie emerges as an extraordinary piece of art. I really dig the nonchalant tone and the soundtrack basically being a "The Smiths" playlist.

## Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, 2004 - ★★★½

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/7/6/3/7/47637-anchorman-the-legend-of-ron-burgundy-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=afdb4fa667" width="300" alt="Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" class="left" >}}

**Review**

 This one delivers a comedic rollercoaster into the quirky realm of broadcast journalism. I found it punching just above alright; it is tailor-made for those who enjoy the absurd and delight in silly escapades. Boasting a star-studded cast, including the incomparable Will Ferrell and the introduction of the uproarious Steve Carell, it's a laugh-out-loud fest with iconic performances. While some dub it a cult classic, personal preferences come into play—take-it-or-leave-it for some, a loony escape for others. Ferrell is in his element, Baxter the dog steals scenes, and the film strikes a balance, ensuring genuine humor without going too over-the-top. For a dose of laughter, a touch of heart, and the sheer joy of Ferrell's comedic genius, "Anchorman" serves up a memorable and entertaining experience.

## Frailty, 2001 - ★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/4/7/5/3/44753-frailty-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=bfa48588cf" width="300" alt="Frailty" class="right" >}}

**Watched on**: 25 October 2023

**Review**

 This one unfolds as a cinematic journey not easily confined to traditional genres. The nostalgic 90s film filter immerses viewers in a world that is both unsettling and enthralling. The film boasts a robust cast and a deliberate but divisive build-up. A deep exploration of religious zealotry emerges, challenging preconceptions and delving into the murky territory where intention and abuse intersect. The unsettling revelation that the father's convictions hold a disturbing truth adds a layer of discomfort. A refreshing twist unveils itself, catching many off guard amidst the intensity. Matthew McConaughey's dramatic retellings of past scenes amplify the film's emotional weight. While the dialogue lacks a bit of engagement, "Frailty" doesn't aim to dazzle. Instead, it unfolds a story with raw authenticity, refusing to adhere to conventional attempts at entertainment. This movie's strength lies in its unapologetic narrative, leaving an indelible impression that transcends the conventional bounds of storytelling.
