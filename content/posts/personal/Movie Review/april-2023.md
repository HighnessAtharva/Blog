## Scream VI, 2023 - ★★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/3/9/2/4/4/839244-scream-vi-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=07a255685d" width="300" alt="Scream VI" class="right" >}}

**Watched on**: 26 April 2023

**Review**

 Well, well, well, looks like the Scream franchise still has some life left in it! Scream VI is a slasher masterpiece that will have you screaming for more! This movie is the epitome of meta, self-aware and expectation defying, and I must say, it is an absolute thrill ride from start to finish.The SFX and sound were top-notch, and the gore was so unhinged that it had me covering my eyes and gasping in equal measure. The character development was awesome, especially Jenna Ortega's performance, which was simply outstanding. This movie had me on my toes most of the time, and the payoff was well worth the wait.The references, jokes, and editing were all top-notch, and the overall balance of the movie was impressive. However, there were some instances where some characters survived due to plot armor and unlikely events, but that's a minor gripe compared to the sheer entertainment value of this movie.Overall, Scream VI is a must-watch for any slasher fan, and it definitely brings back the energy to the franchise. I'm giving this movie an A+ and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good scare. So go ahead and scream your lungs out with Scream VI!

## Fresh, 2022 - ★★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/0/6/0/6/4/706064-fresh-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=546285b96d" width="300" alt="Fresh" class="left" >}}

**Review**

 Hold on to your seats, because Fresh is a movie that will leave you feeling, well, fresh! This movie is not for the faint of heart, but for those who love a good psychological thriller, Fresh is a must-watch.The build-up to the title drop is so important and well-crafted that it sets the tone for the entire movie. Shot in a good spot, with interesting interior design and set pieces, Fresh is a feast for the eyes. However, don't let the beautiful aesthetics fool you, because this movie goes deep into some disturbing themes that might be too much for some viewers.The fight sequences were entertaining, but it was the psychological warfare and the subtle ways that characters treated, behaved, or expressed their feelings non-verbally that really intrigued me. And let's not forget about the gross scenes, because Fresh doubles down on them and delivers some truly memorable shit.In many ways, Fresh is a more cultured version of "Raw", with a similar focus on the human psyche and the disturbing things that can happen when it's pushed to its limits. Overall, Fresh is a captivating, intriguing, and thought-provoking movie that will leave you feeling, well, fresh. I'm giving this movie a solid 4 out of 5 and highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good psychological thriller.

## The Sixth Sense, 1999 - ★½

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/1/4/0/7/51407-the-sixth-sense-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=3a05a55f47" width="300" alt="The Sixth Sense" class="right" >}}

**Watched on**: 20 April 2023

**Review**

 Boring ahh movie. Saw the ending plot twist coming miles before it happened. Any movie with a 6 to 13-year-old as a central character is bound to come off more or less as boring to me. Did not enjoy at all. Although there are a few cheats, it's a good idea. The following contains spoilers: His wife is staring at him in the restaurant, and how can a spirit open doors and engage in physical activity in the physical world? However, Osment's acting is really impressive for a ten-year-old.



The Sixth Sense is a wannabe horror film that is simultaneously emotional and thought-provoking. It tries to convey horror but only sells on the aesthetic and the fear of the unknown.

## Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, 2023 - ★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/6/6/2/3/7/566237-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=27ced3fac4" width="300" alt="Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania" class="left" >}}

**Watched on**: 20 April 2023

**Review**

 Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania - a marvel movie that packs in the puns, action, and family fun, yet leaves a little something to be desired. This movie may not have the same punch as some of Marvel's recent hits, but it still brings a good dose of humor and action that's perfect for a night out with the family. The chemistry between Scott and his daughter is a heartwarming touch, and the scene with the multiverse core doppelgangers is a highlight. But let's be real, Kang steals the show. He's the centerpiece of the movie and is played with delicious villainous glee. It's a shame that the build-up to him was bogged down and sludgy, though.While the VFX is impressive for most scenes, there are moments where it's a bit shoddy, which is a bummer. But the action scenes, music, and jokes make up for it, even if the dialogue can be cheesy at times. Overall, this is a decent Marvel movie, but it feels a bit juvenile and parodic. The characters with outrageous designs and Wasp's Mom are not favorites, but the good ending still leaves a positive impression. This is a movie that you can enjoy with the family, but don't expect it to be the best of the Marvel Universe.

## About Time, 2013 - ★★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/uo/th/yf/uz/zSuh8dGwqpsWR7ccvYbfxbSZ37o-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=7276b6e978" width="300" alt="About Time" class="right" >}}

**Review**

 About Time is a movie that transcends the boundaries of time, and leaves you with a feeling of warmth and contentment. From the beginning, I was struck by the beauty of the landscapes and the costumes. The picturesque backdrop made me feel as though I was right there, alongside the characters.The story follows a young man, Tim, who has the unique ability to time travel. He uses his gift to try and find true love, but along the way, he discovers that the true value of time is spending it with the people you love. The father-son relationship was a standout for me - it was touching, and at times, brought tears to my eyes.Rachel McAdams was a joy to watch, and her chemistry with Tim was electric. The comedy in the movie was genuine and witty, leaving me in stitches. The heartfelt moments were what really touched my soul - they were both heartwarming and heart-wrenching.Overall, About Time is a movie that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It's a timeless classic that focuses on the importance of relationships, family, and people. This movie is sexy, foxy, and genuinely comedic. I highly recommend it! Shoutout to Margot Robbie ;)

## Shazam! Fury of the Gods, 2023 - ★★½

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/2/2/4/0/5/522405-shazam-fury-of-the-gods-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=6f53eef30f" width="300" alt="Shazam! Fury of the Gods" class="left" >}}

**Watched on**: 15 April 2023

**Review**

 Shazam! Fury of the Gods, more like Shazam! Furries on the loose! This sequel had its moments, but it wasn't quite electric enough to light up the box office. The humor was on point, and some of the acting performances were great, but the VFX was questionable, and the storyline was all over the place.The trio of Atlas' daughters made a fierce bunch of villains, but some of their character choices were as confusing as trying to decipher Shazam's powers. The first half was more enjoyable than the second, with a good collection of songs to boot.Despite some of its flaws, this light-hearted movie stood out from other superhero flicks, and the character interactions and set-up were nice. The Wonder Woman cameo genuinely surprised me. Also, two post credit scenes? Wow! Overall, Shazam! Fury of the Gods was entertaining, but it could have been done a whole lot better.

## The Last Kingdom: Seven Kings Must Die, 2023 - ★★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/5/3/3/7/8/853378-the-last-kingdom-seven-kings-must-die-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=74ae569bab" width="300" alt="The Last Kingdom: Seven Kings Must Die" class="right" >}}

**Watched on**: 15 April 2023

**Review**

 Hold on to your shields, folks, because The Last Kingdom: Seven Kings Must Die is a blockbuster hit! This movie may have seemed unnecessary after the series finale, but it proved to be a true farewell to all the great characters we've grown to love.This giant episode packed a punch with a plethora of plot developments that left us at the edge of our seats. Uthred, the charming and honorable warrior, was back in all his glory, along with Finnan and the motley crew we've grown to adore. The pacing may have been too fast, and the lack of a central female character was noticeable, but that's to be expected with the transition from episodic to feature-length viewing.The action sequences and VFX were nothing short of wonderful, with high stakes and a high payoff, Last Kingdom style. The final scenes were bittersweet, and we savored every moment of it. The Last Kingdom: Seven Kings Must Die is a fitting conclusion to the epic saga. Skål!

## Red Rocket, 2021 - ★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/8/3/6/2/0/683620-red-rocket-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=073384c9e9" width="300" alt="Red Rocket" class="left" >}}

**Watched on**: 12 April 2023

**Review**

 It's a rollercoaster of emotions, packed with humor, sexiness, and some scenes that will leave you feeling emotionally drained in a good way. The story revolves around a former p*** star who tries to start over in his hometown in Texas, which takes some unexpected turns.The acting is phenomenal, and the set pieces are visually stunning. While some characters are downright unlikable and some scenes feel overly dramatic, the film's unconventional plot and great dialogue more than make up for it. "Red Rocket" is a breath of fresh air, with a fearless approach to tackling controversial themes.Overall, this movie is a must-watch for those looking for a thought-provoking, raunchy, and unique cinematic experience. So, buckle up for a wild ride of a film that's part-depressing, part-inspiring, and all-around entertaining. "Red Rocket" is a rocket worth riding.

## Inland Empire, 2006 - ★★½

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/0/8/2/2/50822-inland-empire-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=b4bd226d73" width="300" alt="Inland Empire" class="right" >}}

**Watched on**: 11 April 2023

**Review**

 Welcome to the twisted world of David Lynch's "Inland Empire" (2006). This film takes you on a surreal and hallucination-inducing journey with its dreamy camera work and sinister schemes. The cinematography is mesmerizing, and the set pieces are captivating. Laura Dern's performance is outstanding, bringing life to the eccentric and mysterious characters in this film.The first half of the movie is more enjoyable, with some truly bothering dialogue and scenes that will burn into your brain. The searing dream-sequence like shots are a treat for the eyes, but the lack of a clear plot can be frustrating. However, that is to be expected from Lynch, and it's more of a personal problem.Overall, "Inland Empire" is not for everyone. It's a challenging and enigmatic film that requires your full attention. It's worth watching for the outstanding visuals and Dern's excellent performance. However, the lack of a coherent plot and the confusing narrative might turn off some viewers. So, if you're in the mood for an abstract and unconventional film, "Inland Empire" might be worth checking out.

## Hush, 2016 - ★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/uy/c2/ed/fu/khDYdmPFlaTqeLQVD4ds4xC1mIf-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=ae158bcac1" width="300" alt="Hush" class="left" >}}

**Watched on**: 11 April 2023

**Review**

 Ladies and gentlemen, silence is golden, but does it make for a good horror movie? Enter "Hush" (2016), a film that's got some unique qualities but falls short in some aspects. The sounds of the film are commendable, and the beginning is genuinely gripping, but things take a nosedive after the attack. The writing and dialogue lack subtlety and come off as a bit cheesy and on the nose, leaving much to be desired.However, the chase and murder scenes are well executed, and the plot is claustrophobic and inventive. "Hush" is a survival horror movie that tries to be more than your average run-of-the-mill thriller, and for the most part, it succeeds. It's not horrifying, but it keeps you on edge, and the good attempts at creating a tense atmosphere make up for some of the flaws.Overall, "Hush" is a decent movie that's worth a watch if you're a fan of the genre. While it's not perfect, the chase scenes and inventive plot make up for some of its shortcomings. So, if you're in the mood for a survival horror movie that's not too scary but still entertaining, "Hush" might be right up your alley.

## Creep, 2014 - ★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/7/4/9/2/8/174928-creep-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=d01c2ba3a8" width="300" alt="Creep" class="right" >}}

**Watched on**: 11 April 2023

**Review**

 Grab your popcorn and cozy up for a horror movie that's more well-acted than scary. Although the camera work and dialogues are commendable, the film's up-close and personal shots and PoV approach don't quite deliver the goosebumps you'd expect from a horror flick. Instead, the cynical and unhinged behavior of the villain portrayed by Mark Duplass takes center stage, making for a captivating and well-executed performance.The runtime can feel like it's dragging at times, but the brutal and abrupt ending brings it all together nicely. The movie is more about the story and acting than the scares, making it an excellent option for those who aren't fond of horror but enjoy a good character study.Overall, "Creep" is a solid movie that's well-acted, but not as frightening or disturbing as some may expect. The film's highlights lie in its portrayal of the villain and the camera work, and the runtime and scares fall a bit short. So, if you're in the mood for a well-acted thriller, "Creep" is definitely worth a watch.

## Barry Lyndon, 1975 - ★★★★½

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/0f/r6/bn/w7/x2JQCgLjieWOwvImeGtLmuNgsrq-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=9c250ee969" width="300" alt="Barry Lyndon" class="left" >}}

**Watched on**: 07 April 2023

**Review**

 Elegant, opulent, and exquisitely crafted, Stanley Kubrick's epic masterpiece, "Barry Lyndon," is a visual and storytelling tour-de-force. Set in 18th-century Europe, the film follows the life of an Irish rogue who climbs the social ladder to become a wealthy gentleman but ultimately faces a tragic downfall.From the very first frame to the last, "Barry Lyndon" is a stunning visual feast that deserves to be seen on the big screen. Kubrick's impeccable attention to detail and the use of natural light give every frame a painterly quality, and the exquisite costumes and production design transport the viewer to another era.The detached narrative style adds to the film's overall elegance and sophistication, and the memorable characters, each with their own distinct quirks and personalities, make the movie feel more alive and engaging.The writing and dialogue are simply outstanding, with every line packing a punch and lingering in the memory long after the film has ended. The plot is complex and layered, with a lot happening in the three-hour runtime, but it never feels slow or tedious.Overall, "Barry Lyndon" is a vintage and Victorian masterpiece that deserves all the accolades it has received. It's a timeless classic that will continue to captivate and enchant audiences for generations to come. If you're a fan of period dramas, art films, or just great cinema in general, then this is a must-watch movie

## Creed III, 2023 - ★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/0/1/6/2/4/601624-creed-iii-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=ca16bf66bc" width="300" alt="Creed III" class="right" >}}

**Watched on**: 01 April 2023

**Review**

 Creed III brings back the familiar storylines of the previous installments of the franchise but adds a new twist to keep things interesting. The time jump and business arc offer a fresh perspective, but the film takes a while to find its footing. Only in the last 30 minutes does the movie pick up pace, culminating in some thrilling action sequences that will have you on the edge of your seat.While the movie does offer some excitement, it lacks the charm and complexity of its predecessors. The characters are not as engaging as they could have been, and the story feels somewhat predictable. However, the inclusion of a new antagonist brings some much-needed change to the series.Overall, Creed III is a decent addition to the franchise, especially for die-hard fans. It may not be a knockout hit, but it certainly holds its own in the ring.

## Avatar: The Way of Water, 2022 - ★★★★½

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/3/0/5/8/63058-avatar-the-way-of-water-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=37a1014065" width="300" alt="Avatar: The Way of Water" class="left" >}}

**Watched on**: 02 April 2023

**Review**

 Avatar: The Way of the Water is an epic spectacle that immerses you in the stunning beauty of Pandora's underwater world. The visual and sound effects of this movie are an absolute treat to watch. The way it's shot and edited keeps you engaged throughout its 192 minutes runtime. It's a rare example of a long movie that never feels like a drag.The story is a slight improvement over the first movie, with some surprising twists that keep you guessing. It borrows from James Cameron's earlier works but with such skill that it still feels fresh and new. The action scenes are exhilarating, and the underwater sequences are a standout.There are some minor flaws, like some cheesy dialogues and a lack of a proper climax, but they hardly matter when compared to the movie's strengths. It's an achievement in filmmaking that's hard to ignore. If you're a fan of the first movie, this is a must-watch. If not, it's still worth seeing for its sheer cinematic beauty and immersive experience. The new characters in this reign supreme. Some moments are very heart-felt and you can feel the tone change from a solo-adventurer to that of a family rearing broda.Overall, Avatar: The Way of the Water is a worthy sequel that sets the stage for what promises to be an epic series. It's a visual feast that's sure to leave you awestruck. I highly recommend it
