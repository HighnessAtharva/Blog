## Seven Samurai, 1954 - ★★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/ji/5q/0k/rv/v6xrz4fr92KY1oNC3HsEvrsvR1n-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=973d70bb0c" width="300" alt="Seven Samurai" class="right" >}}

**Review**

 This epic film stands as a cinematic classic with its complex narrative set in feudal Japan. While the film impresses with its portrayal of samurai values, the lengthiness of certain scenes may test modern viewers' patience.Mifune's performance as the clownish Kikuchiyo adds a layer of entertainment, but misplaced comedy and rushed ending battles detract from the overall experience. Despite these flaws, "Seven Samurai" remains a must-see for those delving into classic Japanese cinema and cultural diversity.

## The Skin I Live In, 2011 - ★★★★

**Review**

 A banger movie that unfolds as a masterfully crafted thriller, boasting beautiful plot twists and technical brilliance. While its predictability may deter some, the film's thematic exploration of 'losing oneself' and 'repercussions of action' is done with finesse.The movie is a visual spectacle, with a disturbed yet wondrous narrative that keeps viewers engaged. Themes of bare skin and a meticulously designed plot make "The Skin I Live In" a work of art, leaving a lasting impact.

## Office Space, 1999 - ★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/0/9/9/1/50991-office-space-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=ecc49b2fbf" width="300" alt="Office Space" class="right" >}}

**Review**

 This film presents a light-hearted take on corporate life, offering entertaining moments and Jennifer Aniston's infectious smile. With a blend of generic 90s humor and on-the-nose dialogues, the film captures the essence of office culture.While some scenes land with laughter, others fall flat. The casual relationship building between the main character and Jennifer Aniston adds charm to this watchable, albeit not exceptional, comedy.

## The Exorcist, 1973 - ★★★½

**Review**

 A classic horror film, delivers a good scare, albeit with dated elements. While the first half sets up the narrative, the second half escalates quickly with brutal and entertaining scenes. The VFX, body gore, and ominous tones contribute to the film's terrifying atmosphere.Though the film has aged, it remains a solid scare-fest with atmospheric brilliance. The intense exorcism scenes and shocking moments overshadow its dated aspects, making it a must-watch for horror enthusiasts.

## Napoleon, 2023 - ★★★½

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/7/4/1/3/7/674137-napoleon-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=8cb54e07b5" width="300" alt="Napoleon" class="right" >}}

**Review**

 "Napoleon" unfolds as an extravagant and epic tale, living up to its hype with grand battles and court politics. While not the best historical movie, it impresses with stunning visuals, especially in the Pyramid, forest, and ice river battle scenes.The film, dominated by Vanessa Kirby's presence, lacks character depth and punch in its dialogue. However, the set, costume, and VFX teams shine, creating a visually striking experience. "Napoleon" may need more character development, but its overall execution is commendable.

## The Call, 2020 - ★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/0/3/9/7/9/503979-the-call-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=74f9a3155f" width="300" alt="The Call" class="left" >}}

**Review**

 a South Korean/Chinese film, explores a generic plot with unexplainable time-paradox interactions. While some scenes, especially those involving violence and gore, redeem the film, its slow and at times dull pace may not resonate with all viewers.Despite its haunting moments, "The Call" struggles to provide a strong emotional connection. The film's redeeming qualities lie in its visuals, violence, and twisted plot, offering sporadic moments of fun amid an otherwise lackluster narrative.

## The Devil's Advocate, 1997 - ★★★½

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/0/7/8/0/50780-the-devil-s-advocate-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=3e200616d7" width="300" alt="The Devil's Advocate" class="right" >}}

**Watched on**: 08 January 2024

**Review**

 This one immerses audiences in the opulent and luxurious world of metropolitan New York. Keanu Reeves, in a memorable role, engages in scenes that linger in the mind, particularly the memorable earring-ripping moment. The court monologues and Al Pacino's revelation speech are solid, building an atmosphere of themes and signs.The film's lavish set and costume design elevate the narrative, although the ending takes an unexpected, somewhat unhinged turn. Memorable lines and dialogues, combined with the exploration of themes, make "The Devils Advocate" a superb cinematic experience.

## Blow Out, 1981 - ★★★½

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/1/0/9/45109-blow-out-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=0d7535d1bb" width="300" alt="Blow Out" class="left" >}}

**Watched on**: 07 January 2024

**Review**

 John Travolta takes the lead, delivering a compelling performance in a tale of corruption, hush-hush business, and tragic endings. While Nancy's character may leave some wanting, Travolta's representation adds depth and intrigue. The B-grade intro sets the tone, and the film's color palette, raunchy dialogues, and film set scenes create a captivating experience.Travolta's character's journey to rectify past wrongs takes unexpected turns, leading the film down a different, thrilling track. "Blow Out" is a testament to Travolta's prowess, with its tragic narrative and exploration of the rabbit hole of corruption.

## Carlito's Way, 1993 - ★★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/8/4/7/3/48473-carlito-s-way-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=62c2c5eb07" width="300" alt="Carlito's Way" class="right" >}}

**Watched on**: 06 January 2024

**Review**

 In Brian DePalma's "Carlito's Way," Al Pacino delivers yet another stellar performance, showcasing his versatility in a role that contrasts sharply with his iconic Scarface character. The film weaves a tale of gangster life, featuring intense shootouts and a perfect blend of romance, deviating from typical tropes.The movie's attention to detail, from the meticulously crafted sets to anxiety-inducing chase scenes, mirrors the caliber of films like Uncut Gems or Good Time. While the color grading and soundtrack could see improvement, Pacino's portrayal, the gripping monologues, and the dark thematic elements make "Carlito's Way" a quintessential gangster setup.

## Wild Things, 1998 - ★★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/1/5/0/6/51506-wild-things-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=bc7b982455" width="300" alt="Wild Things" class="left" >}}

**Review**

 Enter the seductive world of "Wild Things," a tantalizing thriller that effortlessly captures the essence of a 90s masterpiece. The film's brilliant setup, adorned with clever dialogue and a captivating video filter, evokes nostalgia for the era. The plot unfolds with back-to-back twists, keeping viewers on the edge, and the final revelation is nothing short of mind-bending.The characters, each viler than the last, bring a live-action Grand Theft Auto vibe, with their unhinged ambition and GTA-esque demeanor. The trio navigates a world of sensuality and vile atrocities against the picturesque backdrop of bayside beaches. The film's score complements its atmospheric allure, making it a guilty pleasure for those seeking a night of suspense, action, and unabashed thrill.
