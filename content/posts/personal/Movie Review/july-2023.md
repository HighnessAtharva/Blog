**Review**

 This film explodes onto the screen with an ensemble cast that ignites the movie with electrifying performances. Laden with tension, philosophy, and unyielding ambition, this film delves into the complexities of a historic era defined by radicalization and political intrigue.This biographical masterpiece defies convention, eschewing the typical childhood-to-death narrative for a multi-dimensional exploration of a brilliant mind and the burdens of his choices. The movie weaves together a tapestry of memorable scenes, leaving an indelible mark on the audience.Cillian's performance stands as a testament to his craft, breathing life into the character with unwavering conviction. The cinematography is a work of art, capturing pristine landscapes and relying on practical effects rather than CGI, resulting in a visually striking and well-crafted production.Oppenheimer embraces technicality with its military and scientific jargon, immersing the audience in a world of intellect and innovation. The film ingeniously intertwines big-brained individuals throughout history, adding an intriguing layer of crossover to the narrative.Though near-flawless, it occasionally veers off-track with an excessive focus on certain character arcs that dampen the overall experience. Nonetheless, it remains a rare gem in the cinematic landscape, captivating audiences with its brilliance and historical significance.While the movie sparks deep emotions and intellectual contemplation, it leaves one with an insatiable desire for a contrasting experience to shake off the mortal dread. This movie stands tall as a bombastic and captivating tale that illuminates the brilliance and burden of human potential, reminding us of the enduring power of cinema.

## The Flash, 2023 - ★★★½

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/2/5/8/4/5/225845-the-flash-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg" width="300" alt="The Flash" class="right" >}}

**Watched on**: 18 July 2023

**Review**

 "The Flash" brings a refreshing breeze to the DC cinematic universe, infusing the screen with a sense of genuine fun and a visually stunning spectacle. The film's impressive CGI and a powerhouse cast add to the movie's allure, making it an enjoyable watch for superhero enthusiasts.While the storyline takes a different approach to the Flash's narrative, bending reality and embracing the fantastical, it is precisely within this fantastical realm that the film finds its charm. The awe-inspiring scene with Superwoman showcasing her overwhelming power as she obliterates her captors is a highlight that leaves audiences in awe.Batman's iconic presence, armed with awe-inspiring gadgets, his batmobile, and a sleek jet, adds an edge of excitement to the narrative, bridging the gap between mortal and superhuman abilities.Yet, amidst the highs, the Barry Allen doppleganger puppet show feels a tad juvenile and lacks the gravitas expected from a superhero film. It hinders the movie's otherwise consistent tone and narrative flow.Though "The Flash" may not be the pinnacle of DC's filmography, it serves as a decent addition to their roster, offering moments of good fun and breathtaking action. Some scenes excel, while others falter, leaving the overall experience in a state of mild satisfaction.While the film does have its shortcomings, it stands as a commendable effort in breathing life into the iconic speedster. "The Flash" is far from a disastrous outing for the DC universe, and it provides a worthy escapade for superhero enthusiasts seeking a thrilling, visually captivating, yet imperfect adventure.

## Asteroid City, 2023 - ★★★½

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/6/8/5/5/5/668555-asteroid-city-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg" width="300" alt="Asteroid City" class="left" >}}

**Watched on**: 12 July 2023

**Review**

 Wes Anderson assembles a stellar cast to embark on a whimsical journey through an otherworldly landscape. Once again, Anderson's distinctive style takes center stage, captivating audiences with his idiosyncratic dialogue and eccentric characters.The performances in "Asteroid City" are nothing short of extraordinary, with each actor shining brightly in their unique roles. The chemistry between the characters is palpable, adding depth and charm to this interstellar escapade.The film's visual presentation, while undeniably cool, occasionally feels stripped down due to the limited setting of the Asteroid City. Nevertheless, Anderson's artistry manages to bring the cosmic locale to life, painting a captivating backdrop for the unfolding story.Within the quirky tale, several memorable scenes stand out, such as the fascinating plot surrounding the "Science Kids" club and the backstage drama of the Black and White movie theater. The narrative also delves into the touching story of the protagonist, a widower, and his three enchanting, "witchy and vampirical" daughters, each a source of heartwarming delight.However, amidst these delightful moments, the film struggles to establish a clear overarching metaphor or purpose. The absence of a cohesive point leaves the audience searching for deeper meaning, and the conclusion lacks the sense of fulfillment that one might desire.This movie remains a memorable and visually captivating cinematic experience, supported by Anderson's signature style and the outstanding performances of its cast. While it may not achieve the pinnacle of Anderson's filmography, it offers a delightful cosmic detour worth exploring for fans of his quirky storytelling and exquisite dialogue.

## Suzume, 2022 - ★★★½

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/2/2/2/8/1/822281-suzume-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg" width="300" alt="Suzume" class="right" >}}

**Watched on**: 12 July 2023

**Review**

 Makoto Shinkai, the master of enchanting animated storytelling, once again graces the silver screen with "Suzume." Known for his previous works like "Your Name" and "Weathering With You," Shinkai ventures into uncharted territory, delivering a captivating and distinctive narrative.The animation is nothing short of breathtaking, showcasing the unparalleled artistry that Shinkai is renowned for. From the tranquil landscapes to the character design, every frame is a visual masterpiece that immerses the audience in a realm of artistic brilliance.Our protagonist, Suzume, emerges as a refreshing and relatable character, her grounded and amiable nature making her instantly endearing. The delightful blend of odd humor and unreserved affection towards the older male protagonist brings a touch of uniqueness to the film.The concept itself is a breath of fresh air, embracing the bizarre while intertwining captivating scenes from the ordinary fabric of life. The movie's ability to find beauty in the mundane is a testament to Shinkai's storytelling prowess.However, "Suzume" stumbles slightly in its journey, particularly with its climactic moments. The absence of a truly satisfying ending leaves the audience yearning for a more profound resolution.It's a heartwarming and entertaining journey that boasts Shinkai's signature style and charisma. While it charms with its exceptional animation, delightful characters, and novel concept, the film loses a touch of its magic due to its underwhelming climax. Nonetheless, it remains a testament to Shinkai's creative genius, leaving audiences with a lingering appreciation for the beauty of life's quirks and oddities.

## Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, 2023 - ★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/9/2/3/1/8/592318-transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg" width="300" alt="Transformers: Rise of the Beasts" class="left" >}}

**Watched on**: 11 July 2023

**Review**

 In the latest installment of the Transformers saga, "Rise of the Beasts," director Michael Bay presents a rollercoaster of emotions, taking fans on a nostalgic ride through their cherished childhood franchise. This film serves as a definite step up from its predecessor, successfully injecting fresh energy into the series.The introduction of the Maximals is a delightful addition, breathing new life into the battle of the Autobots and Decepticons. These new characters bring excitement and complexity to the story, captivating the audience with their unique abilities and intriguing backstories.The human characters also shine in this movie, proving to be a remarkable ensemble. Their interactions with the Transformers add a human touch and make for engaging and relatable moments throughout the film.However, it is the climax that steals the show, with a surprising GI Joe easter egg that sparks excitement among die-hard fans. This carefully crafted moment of nostalgia elevates the film to new heights.On the downside, the decision to render Optimus Prime emotionally vulnerable may not sit well with some fans. While it adds depth to his character, it might deviate from the traditional stoic leader we know and love.The villains, though formidable and captivating, unfortunately suffer from an anticlimactic downfall, somewhat dampening the impact they could have had on the storyline."Rise of the Beasts" offers a satisfying dose of nostalgia and introduces exciting new elements to the Transformers universe. While not without its flaws, it strikes a balance between honoring the past and exploring new avenues. Transformers fans will find themselves torn between delight and concern as they witness their beloved franchise evolve on the big screen.

## Breathless, 1983 - ★★★½

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/1/1/6/2/51162-breathless-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg" width="300" alt="Breathless" class="right" >}}

**Watched on**: 10 July 2023

**Review**

 Breathless is a film that, despite being an American remake of the acclaimed French original, stands on its own as a highly underrated gem. Last night, I embarked on a cinematic journey that left me captivated and yearning for more. This movie exudes a sense of nostalgia, evoking memories of free-spirited neo-noir films with their eccentric acting and magnetic charm.Richard Gere delivers a standout performance as Jesse, a wild and carefree car thief. He portrays a character who lives in the moment, finding solace in the pages of his favorite comic book, Silver Surfer, a form of pure escapism. However, fate takes a dark turn when a tragic mistake leads to the accidental killing of a police officer, and Jesse's life spirals out of control. Despite the odds stacked against him, he continues his unpredictable journey, guided by survival instincts and a relentless adventure spirit.The film's neo-noir aesthetics harken back to classics like The Hotspot. I cannot help but compare Monica to Jennifer Connelly's portrayal from her alluring role in Career Opportunities. The captivating and often provocative scenes, heightened by the mesmerizing presence of Valérie Kaprisky as Monica, Jesse's newest French girlfriend, make for a visually stunning experience. The soundtrack, featuring the unforgettable Jerry Lee Lewis's "Breathless," adds a pulsating rhythm to the film.Richard Gere proves himself as a multi-layered and versatile actor, immersing himself in the complex nuances of his character. The supporting cast, including Art Metrano as the peculiar scrapyard owner and John P. Ryan as the relentless Lieutenant Parmental, adds depth and dimension to the narrative.The film builds towards a breathless climax, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats. Each twist and turn amplifies the tension, culminating in a finale that will leave audiences gasping for air.While some critics may have overlooked this remake, it deserves recognition for its nostalgic allure and the artistry it brings to the screen. It captures the essence of neo-noir with style and charisma, offering an unforgettable cinematic experience.

## Sanctuary, 2022 - ★★★½

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/8/2/5/4/5/782545-sanctuary-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg" width="300" alt="Sanctuary" class="left" >}}

**Watched on**: 05 July 2023

**Review**

 Sanctuary is a film that blends elements of Malcolm and Marie and Triangle of Sadness, with a touch of Fifty Shades of Grey and a twist of roles reversed. This emotionally and sexually charged movie takes viewers on a captivating journey that leaves them pondering long after the credits roll.The two main characters exhibit an intriguing level of eccentricity, drawing audiences into their tumultuous world. As the story unfolds, it becomes reminiscent of an episode from the gripping television series Succession, with power dynamics and emotional complexities at the forefront.Margaret Qually's standout performance is nothing short of extraordinary. Her portrayal is both expressive and seductive, captivating the audience with every nuanced emotion. It is her magnetic presence that drives the narrative forward and adds depth to the film's intense dialogues.This movie explores a multitude of themes, delving into the intricacies of relationships, power struggles, and hidden desires. Set in just a couple of rooms, the movie focuses on the domestic drama between the two characters, creating an atmosphere that feels intimate and claustrophobic.While the lack of visual imagery may leave some viewers yearning for more, Sanctuary compensates with its raw and unfiltered portrayal of human emotions. It offers a refreshing departure from conventional storytelling, presenting a unique perspective on love, passion, and the complexities of the human psyche.Although the film loses some momentum towards the end, it is a well-packaged and thought-provoking cinematic experience that dares to offer something different. It invites audiences to explore the darker corners of relationships, reminding us that there is often more than meets the eye.
