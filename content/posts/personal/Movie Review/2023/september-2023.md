## Bottoms, 2023 - ★★★★

**Review**

Bottoms explores the complexities of queerness in the realm of classic coming-of-age cinema. Rachel Sennott's performance shines as she navigates the humorous yet awkward journey of adolescence and self-discovery.This film, reminiscent of high school comedies, offers a unique blend of cringe and charm. While some moments may tiptoe into discomfort, this film finds its comedic footing as the narrative unfolds. The leads, true to the teen movie archetype, are lovably delirious and hormonally charged, concocting wild schemes in pursuit of popularity.I liked its portrayal of queerness as an integral part of the characters' identities, not the sole defining feature. It navigates the complexities of sexuality with a blend of lightheartedness and moments of depth, allowing the narrative to breathe.While the depiction of bruises may falter, the film's climax and ending deliver an enjoyable twist, infusing a sense of audacious fun akin to "Project X" meets Disney. The bloopers at the end add a delightful layer of authenticity.This movie almost never adheres to logic, but it compensates with its humor, engagement, and willingness to tackle the intricacies of queerness in the context of a humorous and entertaining storyline. It offers a refreshing and more engaging experience for viewers seeking a blend of humor and heartfelt exploration.

## Blue Beetle, 2023 - ★★
  
{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/4/2/4/8/494248-blue-beetle-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=6368aaa0ca" width="300" alt="Blue Beetle" class="right" >}}

**Watched on**: 20 September 2023

**Review**

Blue Beetle is a lazy cinematic endeavor, a film that aspires to soar but ultimately falters in its execution. While it may find a niche audience among younger viewers, its shortcomings are glaring and contribute to its underwhelming rating.The film's attempt at humor and family dynamics often veers into cringe-worthy territory, straining believability. The plot, particularly the setup of the villain and the acquisition of the Blue Beetle, lacks the engaging depth necessary to captivate audiences.Jaime's journey from a struggling young man to an accidental superhero is a well-worn path, with predictable beats and emotional struggles that don't quite hit the mark. The character development, especially for Victoria and Carapax, feels inconsistent and leaves much to be desired.Despite these shortcomings, there are some redeeming qualities. Jenny Kord's portrayal adds depth to the film, and the Blue Beetle suit, a blend of comic and powerful elements, offers a glimpse of what could have been.The climax, unfortunately, falls flat, lacking the action-packed excitement one expects from a superhero film. The prolonged scenes of the suit rebooting defy logic and test the audience's patience.While it may entertain younger viewers, it falls short of the standards set by the genre's titans. It's a one-time watch, offering glimpses of potential that remain untapped, leaving audiences yearning for a more compelling superhero narrative.

## Talk to Me, 2022 - ★★★★

{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/9/0/8/1/4/4/908144-talk-to-me-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=bf6a2b65cc" width="300" alt="Talk to Me" class="left" >}}

**Review**

This is a chilling testament to the power of innovative horror filmmaking, earning its well-deserved 4/5 stars. This Australian gem, brought to life by Danny and Michael Philippou, former YouTubers turned horror directors, catapults us into a nightmarish world that's as visceral as it is terrifying.From the opening scenes, it's clear that this film isn't just another entry in the genre. It's a masterclass in storytelling, gradually tightening its grip on the audience's psyche. The performances, particularly those of Sophie Wilde, Joe Bird, and Zoe Terakes, are extraordinary, transcending age and experience to deliver gut-wrenching authenticity.This film expertly blends supernatural horror with a politically charged narrative, and while the latter may seem "woke" to some, it's an integral part of the film's fabric, aligning perfectly with the diverse cast of characters.The sense of dread that permeates the film is relentless, drawing you to the edge of your seat, and while it stumbles slightly toward the end, it doesn't diminish the overall impact. This is Australian horror at its finest, rivaling even the most iconic of the genre. It's a visceral, heart-pounding experience that will leave you haunted long after the credits roll.

## Batman, 1989 - ★★★½
  
{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/1/7/8/8/51788-batman-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=368ed6db7a" width="300" alt="Batman" class="right" >}}

**Watched on**: 11 September 2023

**Review**

Tim Burton's 1989 "Batman" remains a pivotal chapter in the annals of superhero cinema, earning a solid entry for its bold attempt to redefine the Caped Crusader. As the cinematic harbinger of the Golden Age of comic book films, it ushered Batman out of the campy shadows and into the dark, brooding realm he deserved.The film's production design and art direction deserve accolades for crafting a mesmerizing Gotham City, a character in its own right, with its eerie yet vibrant aesthetic. Danny Elfman's grandiose score heralds Batman's arrival with an epic flourish.Jack Nicholson's Joker is a maniacal tour de force, stealing scenes and perfectly embodying the zany, gothic world Burton envisioned. Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale adds a touch of romance to the dark narrative.However, the film stumbles with Michael Keaton's portrayal of Batman. His Bruce Wayne lacks the billionaire playboy charisma, and his Batman lacks the imposing presence the character demands.The clash of tones, oscillating between dark subject matter and Burton's youthful, cartoonish gothic style, results in a narrative that fails to build tension. The soundtrack, led by Prince, feels out of place in a Batman film.

## Barbie, 2023 - ★★★½
  
{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/7/7/0/6/4/277064-barbie-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=1b83dc7a71" width="300" alt="Barbie" class="left" >}}

**Watched on**: 07 September 2023

**Review**

"Barbie" emerges as a kaleidoscopic celebration of nostalgia, wrapped in a glossy package. It's a dazzling spectacle of vibrant colors, infectious music, and enchanting dance sequences that'll sweep you off your feet.Margot Robbie's portrayal of the iconic doll is nothing short of a triumph. She embodies Barbie's plastic perfection with a wink of self-awareness, offering a performance that's as charming as it is tongue-in-cheek. The costumes and sets are a jaw-dropping spectacle, a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship behind the film.The movie is a love letter to Barbie's rich history, with meticulous attention to detail in replicating her world. Ken, portrayed with delightful Kenoughness, adds to the whimsy.However, the plot's foray into the human world, with Mattel CEOs and men in black, feels like a misstep, detracting from the film's magic. The ending, too, takes a safe and clichéd route, a slight letdown in an otherwise vivid narrative.It's politically charged in its appeal, aiming to resonate with audiences of all ages and backgrounds, and for the most part, it succeeds in spreading joy through the lens of Barbie's dreamy universe.

## Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, 2005 - ★★★
  
{{< figure src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/ek/qa/d5/cb/18GHWx66uADdY7GM9NL8WRY5GSw-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=cc723e4c2b" width="300" alt="Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" class="right" >}}

**Watched on**: 05 September 2023

**Review**

"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" offers a cocktail of wit, cynicism, and explosive charisma that's as potent as its title suggests. This movie affair may not ascend to the upper echelons of cinematic brilliance, but it possesses a seductive allure that's hard to resist.At its core, this neo-noir homage toys with conventions and leaves you guessing, much like a seasoned magician revealing just enough to maintain intrigue. Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer's partnership is an alchemical blend of snark and charm, their razor-sharp banter providing the film's lifeblood.The plot, though not revolutionary, serves as a scaffolding to showcase the charismatic leads. In the heart of Hollywood, where anything can happen, this film revels in its twisted sense of humor and an ensemble of endearing, if morally dubious, characters.This film is a dark, intoxicating brew that may not linger in your mind forever, but it's an entertaining romp through the underbelly of Tinseltown. Like a night of decadence and danger, it's not the destination but the journey that leaves its mark, making it a worthy addition to your cinematic adventures.
