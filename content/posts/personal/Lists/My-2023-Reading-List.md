# My 2023 Reading List



## Programming Books

With the start of a new year comes a new set of goals, and for many of us, that includes adding to our programming knowledge. Here's my 2023 reading list of books, focusing on Django and FastAPI, to help achieve that goal.

So, that's my 2023 reading list for programming books. I hope this list helps you in your own quest to improve your programming skills. Happy reading!
