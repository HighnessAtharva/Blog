Treat them with respect.\nYour death has not been waiting for your arrival at the appointed hour: it has, for all the years of your life, been racing towards you with the fierce velocity of time‚Äôs arrow. It cannot be evaded, it cannot be bargained with, deflected or placated. All that is given to you is the choice: meet it with open eyes and peace in your heart, go gentle to your reward. Or burn bright, take up arms, and fight the bitch.\nTrust is the most insidious of poisons. Trust sidesteps all of your precautions.\nAll the world and more has rushed eternity‚Äôs length to reach this beat of your heart, screaming down the years. And if you let it, the universe, without drawing breath, will press itself through this fractured second and race to the next, on into a new eternity. Everything that is, the echoes of everything that ever was, the roots of all that will ever be, must pass through this moment that you own. Your only task is to give it pause‚Äîto make it notice.\nKnowledge is a rug of a certain size, and the world is larger. It‚Äôs not what remains uncovered at the edges that should worry you, rather what is swept beneath.\nI had a son and I breathed for him. When we buried him my sorrow consumed me. Was my grief holy? Was it unique? All our hurts and follies are repeated time and again. Generation after generation live the same mistakes. But we‚Äôre not like the fire, or the river, or the wind‚Äîwe‚Äôre not a single tune, its variations played out forever, a game of numbers until the world dies.\nI have been too young to know, and I have been too old to care. It‚Äôs in that oh-so-narrow slice between that memories are made.\nAnd hunger must be fed. Any weapon begs use. The blade itself incites to violence.\nNothing is as cruel as a righteous man. She had been righteous in her time.\nNever be so focused on picking a lock that you forget kicking down the door is also an option.\nSpend too long watching the long game and the short game will kill you.\nThere is a purity in rage. It will burn out sorrow. For a time. It will burn out fear. Even cruelty and hatred will seek shelter, rage wants none of them, only to destroy. Rage is the gift our nature gives to us, shaped by untold years. Why discard it?\nThere might not be a meaning to the world, or in it, but that does not mean that what we do has no meaning.\nMoons might rise and fall, empires wax and wane, even the stars come and go, but there are constants too, and though the story of our kind is ever-changing it is also always the same.\nA million words won‚Äôt push the ice back, not even the breadth of a finger. But one word will break a heart, two will mend it, and three will lay the highest low.\nBut that was never the heart of Sweet Mercy. The shipheart wasn‚Äôt the foundation of the convent. It was always the faith. Always the notion that all men and women are our brothers and our sisters. And that faith doesn‚Äôt end with borders. It doesn‚Äôt care about heresies used to divide us, or whether you speak your prayers to a white star, or to the fields and forests and stones.\nAll leaves must fall in time, she had said. The lives we lived fall away from us, but something remains, something that is part of the tree.\n",
