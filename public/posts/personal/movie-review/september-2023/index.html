I‚Äôve been on a bit of a movie binge, and I‚Äôm excited to chat about the ones I‚Äôve watched. So, let‚Äôs dive in, shall we?\nI‚Äôve had the pleasure of exploring a wide range of films this month. From heartwarming dramas that pulled at my heartstrings to those intense thrillers that had me practically on the edge of my seat, it‚Äôs been a rollercoaster ride of cinematic experiences.\nIn the past few weeks, I‚Äôve hopped between genres, taking in everything from romance to science fiction, and I‚Äôve got some thoughts to share. Whether you‚Äôre on the hunt for movie recommendations or just curious about what‚Äôs been hitting the screens lately, I‚Äôm here to give you the scoop.\nSo, grab some popcorn, get comfy, and let‚Äôs chat about the movies that made my September so entertaining. Who knows, you might just discover your next favorite flick along the way!\nClick the banner below to follow me on Letterboxd and see what I‚Äôm watching next!\nGifted, 2017 - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω Watched on: 28 September 2023\nReview\nGifted is a tender and emotionally charged exploration of the human condition. This cinematic gem transcends the screen to touch the depths of our hearts, showcasing the beauty of humanity in all its complexity.It is a story masterfully woven, a battle for custody of a special genius child between her grandmother and uncle. The narrative unfolds with precision, drawing the audience into the intricate dynamics of the characters. It‚Äôs a tale that resonates on a profound level, reminding us of the depths of love and sacrifice.The performances are pretty good. The characters come to life with such authenticity that you can‚Äôt help but be moved by their struggles and triumphs. The chemistry between the cast is palpable, delivering moments that will bring both smiles and tears.This well-paced movie leaves no room for boredom, maintaining a tight grip on your emotions from start to finish. It‚Äôs a story that reminds us of the power of human connection and the lengths we‚Äôre willing to go for the ones we love.It‚Äôs a film that deserves a place in your heart and a watch in your lifetime.\nRead on Letterboxd\nBottoms, 2023 - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Watched on: 23 September 2023\nReview\nBottoms explores the complexities of queerness in the realm of classic coming-of-age cinema. Rachel Sennott‚Äôs performance shines as she navigates the humorous yet awkward journey of adolescence and self-discovery.This film, reminiscent of high school comedies, offers a unique blend of cringe and charm. While some moments may tiptoe into discomfort, this film finds its comedic footing as the narrative unfolds. The leads, true to the teen movie archetype, are lovably delirious and hormonally charged, concocting wild schemes in pursuit of popularity.I liked its portrayal of queerness as an integral part of the characters‚Äô identities, not the sole defining feature. It navigates the complexities of sexuality with a blend of lightheartedness and moments of depth, allowing the narrative to breathe.While the depiction of bruises may falter, the film‚Äôs climax and ending deliver an enjoyable twist, infusing a sense of audacious fun akin to ‚ÄúProject X‚Äù meets Disney. The bloopers at the end add a delightful layer of authenticity.This movie almost never adheres to logic, but it compensates with its humor, engagement, and willingness to tackle the intricacies of queerness in the context of a humorous and entertaining storyline. It offers a refreshing and more engaging experience for viewers seeking a blend of humor and heartfelt exploration.\nRead on Letterboxd\nBlue Beetle, 2023 - ‚òÖ‚òÖ Watched on: 20 September 2023\nReview\nBlue Beetle is a lazy cinematic endeavor, a film that aspires to soar but ultimately falters in its execution. While it may find a niche audience among younger viewers, its shortcomings are glaring and contribute to its underwhelming rating.The film‚Äôs attempt at humor and family dynamics often veers into cringe-worthy territory, straining believability. The plot, particularly the setup of the villain and the acquisition of the Blue Beetle, lacks the engaging depth necessary to captivate audiences.Jaime‚Äôs journey from a struggling young man to an accidental superhero is a well-worn path, with predictable beats and emotional struggles that don‚Äôt quite hit the mark. The character development, especially for Victoria and Carapax, feels inconsistent and leaves much to be desired.Despite these shortcomings, there are some redeeming qualities. Jenny Kord‚Äôs portrayal adds depth to the film, and the Blue Beetle suit, a blend of comic and powerful elements, offers a glimpse of what could have been.The climax, unfortunately, falls flat, lacking the action-packed excitement one expects from a superhero film. The prolonged scenes of the suit rebooting defy logic and test the audience‚Äôs patience.While it may entertain younger viewers, it falls short of the standards set by the genre‚Äôs titans. It‚Äôs a one-time watch, offering glimpses of potential that remain untapped, leaving audiences yearning for a more compelling superhero narrative.\nRead on Letterboxd\nTalk to Me, 2022 - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Watched on: 13 September 2023\nReview\nThis is a chilling testament to the power of innovative horror filmmaking, earning its well-deserved 4/5 stars. This Australian gem, brought to life by Danny and Michael Philippou, former YouTubers turned horror directors, catapults us into a nightmarish world that‚Äôs as visceral as it is terrifying.From the opening scenes, it‚Äôs clear that this film isn‚Äôt just another entry in the genre. It‚Äôs a masterclass in storytelling, gradually tightening its grip on the audience‚Äôs psyche. The performances, particularly those of Sophie Wilde, Joe Bird, and Zoe Terakes, are extraordinary, transcending age and experience to deliver gut-wrenching authenticity.This film expertly blends supernatural horror with a politically charged narrative, and while the latter may seem ‚Äúwoke‚Äù to some, it‚Äôs an integral part of the film‚Äôs fabric, aligning perfectly with the diverse cast of characters.The sense of dread that permeates the film is relentless, drawing you to the edge of your seat, and while it stumbles slightly toward the end, it doesn‚Äôt diminish the overall impact. This is Australian horror at its finest, rivaling even the most iconic of the genre. It‚Äôs a visceral, heart-pounding experience that will leave you haunted long after the credits roll.\nRead on Letterboxd\nBatman, 1989 - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω Watched on: 11 September 2023\nReview\nTim Burton‚Äôs 1989 ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù remains a pivotal chapter in the annals of superhero cinema, earning a solid entry for its bold attempt to redefine the Caped Crusader. As the cinematic harbinger of the Golden Age of comic book films, it ushered Batman out of the campy shadows and into the dark, brooding realm he deserved.The film‚Äôs production design and art direction deserve accolades for crafting a mesmerizing Gotham City, a character in its own right, with its eerie yet vibrant aesthetic. Danny Elfman‚Äôs grandiose score heralds Batman‚Äôs arrival with an epic flourish.Jack Nicholson‚Äôs Joker is a maniacal tour de force, stealing scenes and perfectly embodying the zany, gothic world Burton envisioned. Kim Basinger‚Äôs Vicki Vale adds a touch of romance to the dark narrative.However, the film stumbles with Michael Keaton‚Äôs portrayal of Batman. His Bruce Wayne lacks the billionaire playboy charisma, and his Batman lacks the imposing presence the character demands.The clash of tones, oscillating between dark subject matter and Burton‚Äôs youthful, cartoonish gothic style, results in a narrative that fails to build tension. The soundtrack, led by Prince, feels out of place in a Batman film.\nRead on Letterboxd\nBarbie, 2023 - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ¬Ω Watched on: 07 September 2023\nReview\n‚ÄúBarbie‚Äù emerges as a kaleidoscopic celebration of nostalgia, wrapped in a glossy package. It‚Äôs a dazzling spectacle of vibrant colors, infectious music, and enchanting dance sequences that‚Äôll sweep you off your feet.Margot Robbie‚Äôs portrayal of the iconic doll is nothing short of a triumph. She embodies Barbie‚Äôs plastic perfection with a wink of self-awareness, offering a performance that‚Äôs as charming as it is tongue-in-cheek. The costumes and sets are a jaw-dropping spectacle, a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship behind the film.The movie is a love letter to Barbie‚Äôs rich history, with meticulous attention to detail in replicating her world. Ken, portrayed with delightful Kenoughness, adds to the whimsy.However, the plot‚Äôs foray into the human world, with Mattel CEOs and men in black, feels like a misstep, detracting from the film‚Äôs magic. The ending, too, takes a safe and clich√©d route, a slight letdown in an otherwise vivid narrative.It‚Äôs politically charged in its appeal, aiming to resonate with audiences of all ages and backgrounds, and for the most part, it succeeds in spreading joy through the lens of Barbie‚Äôs dreamy universe.\nRead on Letterboxd\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang, 2005 - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Watched on: 05 September 2023\nReview\n‚ÄúKiss Kiss Bang Bang‚Äù offers a cocktail of wit, cynicism, and explosive charisma that‚Äôs as potent as its title suggests. This movie affair may not ascend to the upper echelons of cinematic brilliance, but it possesses a seductive allure that‚Äôs hard to resist.At its core, this neo-noir homage toys with conventions and leaves you guessing, much like a seasoned magician revealing just enough to maintain intrigue. Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer‚Äôs partnership is an alchemical blend of snark and charm, their razor-sharp banter providing the film‚Äôs lifeblood.The plot, though not revolutionary, serves as a scaffolding to showcase the charismatic leads. In the heart of Hollywood, where anything can happen, this film revels in its twisted sense of humor and an ensemble of endearing, if morally dubious, characters.This film is a dark, intoxicating brew that may not linger in your mind forever, but it‚Äôs an entertaining romp through the underbelly of Tinseltown. Like a night of decadence and danger, it‚Äôs not the destination but the journey that leaves its mark, making it a worthy addition to your cinematic adventures.\nRead on Letterboxd\n",

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>Bottoms explores the complexities of queerness in the realm of classic coming-of-age cinema. Rachel Sennott&rsquo;s performance shines as she navigates the humorous yet awkward journey of adolescence and self-discovery.This film, reminiscent of high school comedies, offers a unique blend of cringe and charm. While some moments may tiptoe into discomfort, this film finds its comedic footing as the narrative unfolds. The leads, true to the teen movie archetype, are lovably delirious and hormonally charged, concocting wild schemes in pursuit of popularity.I liked its portrayal of queerness as an integral part of the characters&rsquo; identities, not the sole defining feature. It navigates the complexities of sexuality with a blend of lightheartedness and moments of depth, allowing the narrative to breathe.While the depiction of bruises may falter, the film&rsquo;s climax and ending deliver an enjoyable twist, infusing a sense of audacious fun akin to &ldquo;Project X&rdquo; meets Disney. The bloopers at the end add a delightful layer of authenticity.This movie almost never adheres to logic, but it compensates with its humor, engagement, and willingness to tackle the intricacies of queerness in the context of a humorous and entertaining storyline. It offers a refreshing and more engaging experience for viewers seeking a blend of humor and heartfelt exploration.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>Blue Beetle is a lazy cinematic endeavor, a film that aspires to soar but ultimately falters in its execution. While it may find a niche audience among younger viewers, its shortcomings are glaring and contribute to its underwhelming rating.The film&rsquo;s attempt at humor and family dynamics often veers into cringe-worthy territory, straining believability. The plot, particularly the setup of the villain and the acquisition of the Blue Beetle, lacks the engaging depth necessary to captivate audiences.Jaime&rsquo;s journey from a struggling young man to an accidental superhero is a well-worn path, with predictable beats and emotional struggles that don&rsquo;t quite hit the mark. The character development, especially for Victoria and Carapax, feels inconsistent and leaves much to be desired.Despite these shortcomings, there are some redeeming qualities. Jenny Kord&rsquo;s portrayal adds depth to the film, and the Blue Beetle suit, a blend of comic and powerful elements, offers a glimpse of what could have been.The climax, unfortunately, falls flat, lacking the action-packed excitement one expects from a superhero film. The prolonged scenes of the suit rebooting defy logic and test the audience&rsquo;s patience.While it may entertain younger viewers, it falls short of the standards set by the genre&rsquo;s titans. It&rsquo;s a one-time watch, offering glimpses of potential that remain untapped, leaving audiences yearning for a more compelling superhero narrative.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>This is a chilling testament to the power of innovative horror filmmaking, earning its well-deserved 4/5 stars. This Australian gem, brought to life by Danny and Michael Philippou, former YouTubers turned horror directors, catapults us into a nightmarish world that&rsquo;s as visceral as it is terrifying.From the opening scenes, it&rsquo;s clear that this film isn&rsquo;t just another entry in the genre. It&rsquo;s a masterclass in storytelling, gradually tightening its grip on the audience&rsquo;s psyche. The performances, particularly those of Sophie Wilde, Joe Bird, and Zoe Terakes, are extraordinary, transcending age and experience to deliver gut-wrenching authenticity.This film expertly blends supernatural horror with a politically charged narrative, and while the latter may seem &ldquo;woke&rdquo; to some, it&rsquo;s an integral part of the film&rsquo;s fabric, aligning perfectly with the diverse cast of characters.The sense of dread that permeates the film is relentless, drawing you to the edge of your seat, and while it stumbles slightly toward the end, it doesn&rsquo;t diminish the overall impact. This is Australian horror at its finest, rivaling even the most iconic of the genre. It&rsquo;s a visceral, heart-pounding experience that will leave you haunted long after the credits roll.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>Tim Burton&rsquo;s 1989 &ldquo;Batman&rdquo; remains a pivotal chapter in the annals of superhero cinema, earning a solid entry for its bold attempt to redefine the Caped Crusader. As the cinematic harbinger of the Golden Age of comic book films, it ushered Batman out of the campy shadows and into the dark, brooding realm he deserved.The film&rsquo;s production design and art direction deserve accolades for crafting a mesmerizing Gotham City, a character in its own right, with its eerie yet vibrant aesthetic. Danny Elfman&rsquo;s grandiose score heralds Batman&rsquo;s arrival with an epic flourish.Jack Nicholson&rsquo;s Joker is a maniacal tour de force, stealing scenes and perfectly embodying the zany, gothic world Burton envisioned. Kim Basinger&rsquo;s Vicki Vale adds a touch of romance to the dark narrative.However, the film stumbles with Michael Keaton&rsquo;s portrayal of Batman. His Bruce Wayne lacks the billionaire playboy charisma, and his Batman lacks the imposing presence the character demands.The clash of tones, oscillating between dark subject matter and Burton&rsquo;s youthful, cartoonish gothic style, results in a narrative that fails to build tension. The soundtrack, led by Prince, feels out of place in a Batman film.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Barbie&rdquo; emerges as a kaleidoscopic celebration of nostalgia, wrapped in a glossy package. It&rsquo;s a dazzling spectacle of vibrant colors, infectious music, and enchanting dance sequences that&rsquo;ll sweep you off your feet.Margot Robbie&rsquo;s portrayal of the iconic doll is nothing short of a triumph. She embodies Barbie&rsquo;s plastic perfection with a wink of self-awareness, offering a performance that&rsquo;s as charming as it is tongue-in-cheek. The costumes and sets are a jaw-dropping spectacle, a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship behind the film.The movie is a love letter to Barbie&rsquo;s rich history, with meticulous attention to detail in replicating her world. Ken, portrayed with delightful Kenoughness, adds to the whimsy.However, the plot&rsquo;s foray into the human world, with Mattel CEOs and men in black, feels like a misstep, detracting from the film&rsquo;s magic. The ending, too, takes a safe and clich√©d route, a slight letdown in an otherwise vivid narrative.It&rsquo;s politically charged in its appeal, aiming to resonate with audiences of all ages and backgrounds, and for the most part, it succeeds in spreading joy through the lens of Barbie&rsquo;s dreamy universe.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang&rdquo; offers a cocktail of wit, cynicism, and explosive charisma that&rsquo;s as potent as its title suggests. This movie affair may not ascend to the upper echelons of cinematic brilliance, but it possesses a seductive allure that&rsquo;s hard to resist.At its core, this neo-noir homage toys with conventions and leaves you guessing, much like a seasoned magician revealing just enough to maintain intrigue. Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer&rsquo;s partnership is an alchemical blend of snark and charm, their razor-sharp banter providing the film&rsquo;s lifeblood.The plot, though not revolutionary, serves as a scaffolding to showcase the charismatic leads. In the heart of Hollywood, where anything can happen, this film revels in its twisted sense of humor and an ensemble of endearing, if morally dubious, characters.This film is a dark, intoxicating brew that may not linger in your mind forever, but it&rsquo;s an entertaining romp through the underbelly of Tinseltown. Like a night of decadence and danger, it&rsquo;s not the destination but the journey that leaves its mark, making it a worthy addition to your cinematic adventures.</p>
