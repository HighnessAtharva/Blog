Check out April Movie Recap\nAmidst the whirlwind of academic and professional commitments, I managed to carve out precious moments to immerse myself in the magic of cinema. The month of May brought forth an array of highly anticipated films, and while my movie-watching endeavors were limited, the experiences I had were truly captivating. This is partly to blame on TV shows like Better Call Saul which I recently finished and Succession which I just picked up and have been obsessively binge watching. But hey, this blog is about movies! Brace yourselves as I take you on a thrilling journey through some of the cinematic gems that left an indelible mark on my imagination.\nClick the banner below to follow me on Letterboxd and see what I‚Äôm watching next!\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4, 2023 - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Watched on: 23 May 2023\nReview\nPrepare to be on the edge of your seat as John Wick returns in ‚ÄúChapter 4,‚Äù delivering a nerve-wracking action experience that rivals the intensity of a superhero movie. This latest installment of the franchise takes the already high-octane action to new heights, surpassing its predecessors in a relentless onslaught of jaw-dropping sequences.From the very beginning, the film catapults you into a world where combat reigns supreme. John Wick, portrayed by the enigmatic Keanu Reeves, is once again the unstoppable force we‚Äôve come to know and admire. Armed with his signature blend of precise gunplay and lethal hand-to-hand combat, Wick embarks on a blood-soaked journey that defies all logic and leaves you breathless. Nun chucks face blasts were a godsend!The action sequences in here are a mind-boggling spectacle, pushing the boundaries of what seems humanly possible. Wick‚Äôs encounters with armored samurais, biker gangs, and the relentless High Table assassins are nothing short of astonishing. Director Chad Stahelski orchestrates each fight with impeccable precision, weaving together a symphony of violence that is both visually stunning and emotionally engaging.While the film boasts an impressive array of cool side characters and a satisfying ending, it falls slightly short of perfection due to a juvenile villain and an overly grandiose plot. However, these minor flaws are easily overshadowed by the sheer adrenaline rush provided by the relentless action.‚ÄúJohn Wick: Chapter 4‚Äù cements itself as one of the best franchises of our time, delivering a captivating blend of stylized violence, complex choreography, and intense storytelling. It‚Äôs a rollercoaster ride of non-stop excitement that will leave you both exhilarated and craving for more. Buckle up and brace yourself for an extraordinary cinematic experience.\nRead on Letterboxd\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, 2023 - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Watched on: 14 May 2023\nReview\nPrepare to embark on another intergalactic journey with the beloved misfit crew in ‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,‚Äù a blessing for the post-Thanos Marvel Cinematic Universe. This installment brings back the quirky charm and infectious humor that made the previous films so delightful.The story picks up with the Guardians facing a new challenge as they reunite to save Rocket, who finds himself in a perilous predicament. The dynamic between the characters remains the heart and soul of the movie, with Star-Lord‚Äôs melancholy providing an unexpected twist. However, it doesn‚Äôt take long for the team to find their footing and deliver the hilarious banter and camaraderie we‚Äôve come to adore.One of the highlights of the film is the impeccable soundtrack, which serves as a perfect accompaniment to the cosmic adventure. The battles and coordinated fight scenes, although somewhat sparse, are visually impressive, though the 3D effects could have been more immersive.The characters continue to shine, bouncing off each other with their unique personalities and adding depth to the story. Rocket takes center stage as a central character, while Gamora surprises with her fierce presence. The movie doesn‚Äôt shy away from tugging at the heartstrings, exploring the softer and more emotional side of the narrative.While the villain may not leave a lasting impression, the overall experience of ‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3‚Äù is a testament to its entertainment value. It‚Äôs a great movie to watch with friends, offering a captivating blend of humor, action, and a dash of sentimentality. Marvel fans will find plenty to enjoy in this latest addition to the cosmic saga.\nRead on Letterboxd\nEvil Dead Rise, 2023 - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Watched on: 09 May 2023\nReview\nEvil Dead Rise, the latest installment in the Evil Dead franchise, is a blood-soaked extravaganza that delivers on the gore and the screams, but falls short in other aspects. This movie is a mixed bag of hilarious try-hard scares, mediocre acting, lazy writing and disappointing character development.Despite its flaws, Evil Dead Rise succeeds in creating a truly unhinged and violent atmosphere that is sure to leave horror fans satisfied. The variety of kills, jump scares, lighting, weapons, and visual effects are impressive, making for a thrilling and visually stunning experience.However, the movie‚Äôs weak points are hard to overlook. The dialogue is often shoddy and lazy, and the characters are uninteresting, making it difficult to feel connected to their plight. At times, the violence and gore become so excessive that they border on juvenile, taking away from the overall horror experience.Overall, Evil Dead Rise is a good and entertaining watch for horror fans looking for a flesh extravaganza. While it falls short in some aspects, the movie‚Äôs sheer brutality and stunning visual effects make for a worthwhile experience.\nRead on Letterboxd\nDungeons \u0026 Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, 2023 - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ Watched on: 03 May 2023\nReview\nListen up, fantasy nerds! We‚Äôve finally got an entertaining Dungeons \u0026 Dragons movie on our hands! ‚ÄúHonor Among Thieves‚Äù doesn‚Äôt suck ass like the last few attempts at bringing our beloved world to the big screen. This movie is wholly entertaining, meta, and self-aware. It‚Äôs like the filmmakers knew they had a lot to make up for, and they nailed it!The casting was on point, with each actor perfectly fitting their role. The VFX may have some rough spots, but it‚Äôs hard not to laugh when the levitation, summoning, and extreme expression-driven acting come into play. It‚Äôs all intentional, trust me.The lore and world-building is rich and deep, as one would expect from Dungeons \u0026 Dragons. And let‚Äôs talk about the action sequences - they‚Äôre a delight! The comedy is on point, and the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù aspect of it all is captivating. The movie is light-hearted and inventive, and the camera work and editing are pretty great.Overall, ‚ÄúDungeons \u0026 Dragons: Honor Among Thieves‚Äù is a thieving delight! It‚Äôs definitely worth watching, especially for the fantasy nerds out there\nRead on Letterboxd\n",

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>Prepare to be on the edge of your seat as John Wick returns in &ldquo;Chapter 4,&rdquo; delivering a nerve-wracking action experience that rivals the intensity of a superhero movie. This latest installment of the franchise takes the already high-octane action to new heights, surpassing its predecessors in a relentless onslaught of jaw-dropping sequences.From the very beginning, the film catapults you into a world where combat reigns supreme. John Wick, portrayed by the enigmatic Keanu Reeves, is once again the unstoppable force we&rsquo;ve come to know and admire. Armed with his signature blend of precise gunplay and lethal hand-to-hand combat, Wick embarks on a blood-soaked journey that defies all logic and leaves you breathless. Nun chucks face blasts were a godsend!The action sequences in here are a mind-boggling spectacle, pushing the boundaries of what seems humanly possible. Wick&rsquo;s encounters with armored samurais, biker gangs, and the relentless High Table assassins are nothing short of astonishing. Director Chad Stahelski orchestrates each fight with impeccable precision, weaving together a symphony of violence that is both visually stunning and emotionally engaging.While the film boasts an impressive array of cool side characters and a satisfying ending, it falls slightly short of perfection due to a juvenile villain and an overly grandiose plot. However, these minor flaws are easily overshadowed by the sheer adrenaline rush provided by the relentless action.&ldquo;John Wick: Chapter 4&rdquo; cements itself as one of the best franchises of our time, delivering a captivating blend of stylized violence, complex choreography, and intense storytelling. It&rsquo;s a rollercoaster ride of non-stop excitement that will leave you both exhilarated and craving for more. Buckle up and brace yourself for an extraordinary cinematic experience.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>Prepare to embark on another intergalactic journey with the beloved misfit crew in &ldquo;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,&rdquo; a blessing for the post-Thanos Marvel Cinematic Universe. This installment brings back the quirky charm and infectious humor that made the previous films so delightful.The story picks up with the Guardians facing a new challenge as they reunite to save Rocket, who finds himself in a perilous predicament. The dynamic between the characters remains the heart and soul of the movie, with Star-Lord&rsquo;s melancholy providing an unexpected twist. However, it doesn&rsquo;t take long for the team to find their footing and deliver the hilarious banter and camaraderie we&rsquo;ve come to adore.One of the highlights of the film is the impeccable soundtrack, which serves as a perfect accompaniment to the cosmic adventure. The battles and coordinated fight scenes, although somewhat sparse, are visually impressive, though the 3D effects could have been more immersive.The characters continue to shine, bouncing off each other with their unique personalities and adding depth to the story. Rocket takes center stage as a central character, while Gamora surprises with her fierce presence. The movie doesn&rsquo;t shy away from tugging at the heartstrings, exploring the softer and more emotional side of the narrative.While the villain may not leave a lasting impression, the overall experience of &ldquo;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&rdquo; is a testament to its entertainment value. It&rsquo;s a great movie to watch with friends, offering a captivating blend of humor, action, and a dash of sentimentality. Marvel fans will find plenty to enjoy in this latest addition to the cosmic saga.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>Evil Dead Rise, the latest installment in the Evil Dead franchise, is a blood-soaked extravaganza that delivers on the gore and the screams, but falls short in other aspects. This movie is a mixed bag of hilarious try-hard scares, mediocre acting, lazy writing and disappointing character development.Despite its flaws, Evil Dead Rise succeeds in creating a truly unhinged and violent atmosphere that is sure to leave horror fans satisfied. The variety of kills, jump scares, lighting, weapons, and visual effects are impressive, making for a thrilling and visually stunning experience.However, the movie&rsquo;s weak points are hard to overlook. The dialogue is often shoddy and lazy, and the characters are uninteresting, making it difficult to feel connected to their plight. At times, the violence and gore become so excessive that they border on juvenile, taking away from the overall horror experience.Overall, Evil Dead Rise is a good and entertaining watch for horror fans looking for a flesh extravaganza. While it falls short in some aspects, the movie&rsquo;s sheer brutality and stunning visual effects make for a worthwhile experience.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>Listen up, fantasy nerds! We&rsquo;ve finally got an entertaining Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie on our hands! &ldquo;Honor Among Thieves&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t suck ass like the last few attempts at bringing our beloved world to the big screen. This movie is wholly entertaining, meta, and self-aware. It&rsquo;s like the filmmakers knew they had a lot to make up for, and they nailed it!The casting was on point, with each actor perfectly fitting their role. The VFX may have some rough spots, but it&rsquo;s hard not to laugh when the levitation, summoning, and extreme expression-driven acting come into play. It&rsquo;s all intentional, trust me.The lore and world-building is rich and deep, as one would expect from Dungeons &amp; Dragons. And let&rsquo;s talk about the action sequences - they&rsquo;re a delight! The comedy is on point, and the &ldquo;magic&rdquo; aspect of it all is captivating. The movie is light-hearted and inventive, and the camera work and editing are pretty great.Overall, &ldquo;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves&rdquo; is a thieving delight! It&rsquo;s definitely worth watching, especially for the fantasy nerds out there</p>
