  "articleBody": "February was a month for the ages as I indulged in a smorgasbord of movies. From the laugh-out-loud comedy of “Rush Hour” to the mind-bending sci-fi of “Solaris” and everything in between, I’ve got a lot to say about the films I watched. There were some classics from the past like “Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind” and “Porco Rosso,” as well as newer releases like “Infinity Pool” and “Babylon.” I also braved the horror genre with “Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum” and “Incantation,” and explored the dark side of humanity with “Only God Forgives” and “A Cure for Wellness.” So buckle up and get ready for my take on these 14 movies, ranging from a half-star dud to a four-and-a-half-star masterpiece. I hope you enjoy reading my reviews as much as I enjoyed watching these films! Let’s get started.\nClick the banner below to follow me on Letterboxd and see what I’m watching next!\nRush Hour 3, 2007 - ★★★ Rush Hour 2, 2001 - ★★★★ Rush Hour, 1998 - ★★★½ Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, 1984 - ★★★★ Only God Forgives, 2013 - ★★★ Porco Rosso, 1992 - ★★★ Infinity Pool, 2023 - ★★★★½ Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum, 2018 - ★★★ Incantation, 2022 - ★★★ A Cure for Wellness, 2016 - ★★★★ T2 Trainspotting, 2017 - ★★★½ Solaris, 1972 - ★★★ Spring Breakers, 2012 - ★½ Babylon, 2022 - ★★★½ Rush Hour 3, 2007 - ★★★ Watched on: 26 February 2023\nReview\nThe third installment in the classic action-comedy franchise starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. This time around, the duo finds themselves in Paris on the hunt for a dangerous crime syndicate. While the film doesn’t quite reach the heights of the first two movies, it still has plenty of entertaining moments to offer.One of the strengths of the film is the chemistry between Chan and Tucker. They have a great dynamic that brings a lot of humor and heart to the movie. Their classic banter and comedic timing are on full display, and they still manage to pull off some impressive action sequences as well.Speaking of action, this one takes us on a wild journey through Paris, featuring some thrilling set pieces and chase scenes. The city provides a beautiful backdrop for the action, and the film makes great use of its locations.However, the plot can be a bit convoluted at times, with too many twists and turns that don’t always make sense. The supporting characters aren’t particularly memorable either, and the film relies a bit too heavily on tired stereotypes for some of its humor.Although it’s my least favorite of the three, it is not a disaster in any way. If you’re looking for some laughs and exciting action, it’s worth checking out.\nRead on Letterboxd\nRush Hour 2, 2001 - ★★★★ Watched on: 26 February 2023\nReview\nRush Hour 2 is a knockout sequel that packs a comedic punch. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are back with their signature banter and over-the-top antics, making for some hilarious moments. The soundtrack is also fire, adding to the fun and energy of the film.The movie doesn’t shy away from crude humor and dialogue, which some may find off-putting, but for those who enjoy it, it’s a laugh riot. And the female actresses in the film are perfect, adding some much-needed depth and complexity to the story.What really sets this movie apart, though, is the solid ending that ties everything together. Plus, there are tons of references to the first movie that fans will appreciate. Overall, “Rush Hour 2” is my favorite of the trilogy and definitely worth a watch - just don’t rush through it too quickly.\nRead on Letterboxd\nRush Hour, 1998 - ★★★½ Watched on: 25 February 2023\nReview\n“Rush Hour” is a unique and entertaining buddy cop movie that has stood the test of time. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker star as a mismatched pair of law enforcement officers who are tasked with finding a kidnapped girl. Along the way, they encounter a slew of dangerous characters and must rely on each other to survive.One of the strengths of the movie is the plot, which keeps the audience engaged and guessing until the very end. The plot twist at the heart of the movie is executed well and adds a layer of depth to the characters and their relationship.Speaking of characters, the acting in “Rush Hour” is top-notch. Chan and Tucker have great chemistry and their banter is both funny and endearing. They both bring their unique talents to the table - Chan with his impressive martial arts skills and Tucker with his quick wit and humor.The film also features some memorable supporting characters, including the villainous Juntao and the feisty but capable police officer, Sang. They add some variety and depth to the story and keep things interesting.What sets “Rush Hour” apart from other buddy cop movies is its ability to balance action and humor. The movie is filled with exciting fight scenes and thrilling car chases, but also has plenty of laugh-out-loud moments that make it a fun and enjoyable ride.Overall, “Rush Hour” is a timeless classic that is definitely worth a rewatch. It may not be perfect, but it’s a unique and entertaining film that showcases the talents of its cast and crew. If you’re in the mood for some action-packed humor, “Rush Hour” is a solid choice.\nRead on Letterboxd\nNausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, 1984 - ★★★★ Watched on: 24 February 2023\nReview\nPrepare to be transported to a magical world of stunning animation and a heartfelt story with “Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.” This Ghibli classic is a must-watch for fans of the studio’s style.The animation is superb, as expected from Ghibli, with breathtaking scenery and stunning visuals that transport you to a different world. The retro style adds a layer of charm and nostalgia to the film that is hard to resist.The plot is interesting and engaging, with a lot to say about environmental crises that still resonates today. And the character of Nausicaa is a standout, a memorable and sweet protagonist who embodies the film’s message of compassion and empathy.Overall, “Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind” is a well-planned out film that balances important themes with a comforting and nostalgic style. It’s the perfect comfort movie to watch and rewatch, and a must-see for any Ghibli fan.\nRead on Letterboxd\nOnly God Forgives, 2013 - ★★★ Watched on: 19 February 2023\nReview\nGet ready for a neon-soaked, violent ride with “Only God Forgives.” This Ryan Gosling-starrer is a dark and brooding film that’s best watched late at night when the world is quiet.Gosling plays his usual role of a silent, hard man battling against the odds and being pushed to his limits. The movie drips neon everywhere, with a unique visual style that’s hard to ignore.The plot is interesting but feels short-lived and generic, with only a few moments that truly hit hard. However, those scenes are visually stunning and depict violence in a way that’s both shocking and mesmerizing.Overall, this movie is a mixed bag. It has moments of greatness, but they’re few and far between. If you’re a fan of Gosling or violent, neon-soaked films, give it a watch. But don’t expect to be blown away.\nRead on Letterboxd\nPorco Rosso, 1992 - ★★★ Watched on: 18 February 2023\nReview\nSettle in for a visually stunning journey through the skies with “Porco Rosso.” While it may not be my favorite Ghibli movie, it still boasts the studio’s trademark animation style that’s hard to beat.The story is a bit more political and non-traditional than other Ghibli movies, which might not be everyone’s cup of tea. But if you’re looking for something different and thought-provoking, this movie might just be for you.The character of Porco Rosso is also a standout, a charming and complex protagonist who’s hard not to root for. And of course, the visuals are breathtaking, with stunning depictions of flight and aerial combat.Overall, “Porco Rosso” might not be the most traditional Ghibli movie, but it still has a lot to offer for those looking for a visually stunning and thought-provoking experience.\nRead on Letterboxd\nInfinity Pool, 2023 - ★★★★½ Watched on: 14 February 2023\nReview\nPrepare yourself for a dark, psychedelic thrill ride with “Infinity Pool,” the freshest and most demonic sci-fi adventure in a long time.Mia Goth absolutely slays it with her acting, delivering memorable dialogue and scenes that will stay with you long after the credits roll. And Alexander Skarsgard? He’s as cool and sharp as ever.The movie is bursting with gore and sexual energy, with dark and creepy scenes that will make you feel like you’re watching an A24 production. It’s a rollercoaster of a movie, with twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the very end.If you’re a fan of thrillers, sci-fi, and anything with a touch of the demonic, then “Infinity Pool” is a must-watch. It’s my favorite movie of the month and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a dark and unforgettable adventure.\nRead on Letterboxd\nGonjiam: Haunted Asylum, 2018 - ★★★ Watched on: 12 February 2023\nReview\nGonjiam: Haunted Asylum is like a scary live-stream that goes viral, but with more ghosts and fewer influencers. The first half sets up the spooky story and the characters, but it moves slower than a snail on a treadmill. The second half delivers the thrills and chills, leaving your brain scrambled like an egg on a hot skillet. And those last 10 minutes? Legendary. But let’s be real, you’ll need to watch it late at night, by yourself, and with the lights off to fully appreciate the creep factor. Overall, it’s worth the watch if you’re in the mood for a haunted house tale, just don’t expect it to be a scream fest.\nRead on Letterboxd\nIncantation, 2022 - ★★★ Watched on: 12 February 2023\nReview\nIncantation is a creepy and culty movie that’s not for the faint of heart. While it may not scare everyone, it certainly delivers on the visuals and the alternative vibes. The movie draws from a dark place that can be difficult to relate to, but it’s still intriguing to watch. The imagery can be downright terrifying, especially if you’re invested in the lore. The PoV scenes are done well and add a nice touch to the film. However, the ending is predictable and overacted, which can detract from the overall experience.If you’re into horror movies that involve cults and incantations, this might be up your alley. The movie feels like a cross between The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity, with a ton of lore surrounding the incantation itself. The source material is unique, and the visuals make it worth the watch. But if you’re looking for a scream-fest, this might not be the movie for you. Overall, Incantation is worth checking out if you’re into the genre, just don’t expect it to blow your mind.\nRead on Letterboxd\nA Cure for Wellness, 2016 - ★★★★ Watched on: 10 February 2023\nReview\nA Cure for Wellness is a phantasmagorical tale that will take you on a journey through the depths of the human psyche. Mia Goth once again delivers a great performance, and the movie is filled with creepy experiments in basements, shady castles, and Victorian locations that will leave you on edge. I enjoyed the acting, drama, and intimate scenes, but what really stands out is the lore surrounding the central location of the plot. It’s all tied together seamlessly, and the ending may be a bit overblown but it’s still a satisfying conclusion.Overall, this movie is a must-watch for anyone who loves dark and vividly charming tales. It’s a perfect blend of horror and mystery, with a fantastic cast and captivating storyline. The Victorian locations and eerie atmosphere create an immersive experience that’s hard to forget. If you’re a fan of movies like Crimson Peak, you’ll definitely appreciate A Cure for Wellness. So, don’t miss out on this gem of a movie!\nRead on Letterboxd\nT2 Trainspotting, 2017 - ★★★½ Watched on: 07 February 2023\nReview\nT2 Trainspotting is the long-awaited sequel to the cult classic movie, and it definitely delivers. The jokes are still relevant and updated for the modern age, and the throwbacks and references to the events of the first film are awesome. The same old characters are back, and their charming British rows are a joy to watch.Dialogue and drama are the centerpiece of this movie, with bar fights, epic monologues, and disastrous yet comedic situations that will keep you entertained from start to finish. While the ending may be a bit of a letdown, it’s still a self-contained narrative that stands on its own.Overall, T2 Trainspotting is a great movie that will leave you feeling nostalgic and satisfied. It’s a must-watch for fans of the original film, and even those who haven’t seen it will appreciate the witty dialogue and engaging storyline. So, grab some popcorn and settle in for a wild ride with the gang from Trainspotting!\nRead on Letterboxd\nSolaris, 1972 - ★★★ Watched on: 07 February 2023\nReview\n“Space, the final frontier,” or so it goes in “Solaris,” a sci-fi movie that’s about as poetic as it is long-winded. Clocking in at three hours, it’s definitely not for the faint of heart, but if you’re up for some slow-burn, existential dread, then this might be your cup of tea. The movie’s iconic stares and old-school visual effects give it a certain charm, but there’s no denying that it’s a product of its time. The plot centers around a sentient water body on an alien planet that manipulates the psyche of the people that come into contact with it, exploring the ethics and morality of what it means to be a being. While the narrative does fit well with the book, the movie could have definitely been trimmed down. All in all, “Solaris” is a tale that’s worth checking out if you’re in the mood for something slow and thought-provoking.\nRead on Letterboxd\nSpring Breakers, 2012 - ★½ Watched on: 05 February 2023\nReview\n“Spring Breakers” is a movie that’s all style and no substance. With gratuitous skin shots and an ostentatious display of wealth, it’s hard to find any real depth in this flick. The plot is highly unrealistic, following a group of girls who fall for a mob boss and get caught up in a world of gunshots and reckless behavior. While the mob boss does drop a few memorable lines, it’s not enough to make up for the lack of substance in the rest of the film. The only redeeming qualities are the good music, some smart jokes and banter, and decent cinematography. Overall, “Spring Breakers” is a bad dream of a movie that’s not worth your time if you’re looking for any sort of thrill or excitement. Save your money and watch something else.\nRead on Letterboxd\nBabylon, 2022 - ★★★½ Watched on: 01 February 2023\nReview\nLights, camera, action! “Babylon” takes us back to the golden age of Hollywood with all the extravagance and drama we’ve come to expect. Margot Robbie delivers a standout performance, stealing every scene she’s in. The costume and set design are equally over the top, transporting us back to the era in all its glory. What really sets this movie apart is its portrayal of the art and mastery of theatre. The acting is top-notch, and the behind-the-scenes scenes are both intriguing and entertaining. The music choices are also spot on, adding to the overall vibe of the film. “Babylon” is definitely an over-the-top movie, with a surreal and grounding philosophical touch that feels like it was directed by Tarantino himself. It’s a banger of a movie, and a huge artistic milestone. Overall, “Babylon” is a must-see for anyone who loves the glitz and glamour of old Hollywood.\nRead on Letterboxd\n",

        <p>Reviews of the movies I watched in February 2023</p>
</figure>
  <div class="post-content"><p>February was a month for the ages as I indulged in a smorgasbord of movies. From the laugh-out-loud comedy of &ldquo;Rush Hour&rdquo; to the mind-bending sci-fi of &ldquo;Solaris&rdquo; and everything in between, I&rsquo;ve got a lot to say about the films I watched. There were some classics from the past like &ldquo;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&rdquo; and &ldquo;Porco Rosso,&rdquo; as well as newer releases like &ldquo;Infinity Pool&rdquo; and &ldquo;Babylon.&rdquo; I also braved the horror genre with &ldquo;Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum&rdquo; and &ldquo;Incantation,&rdquo; and explored the dark side of humanity with &ldquo;Only God Forgives&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Cure for Wellness.&rdquo; So buckle up and get ready for my take on these 14 movies, ranging from a half-star dud to a four-and-a-half-star masterpiece. I hope you enjoy reading my reviews as much as I enjoyed watching these films! Let&rsquo;s get started.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>The third installment in the classic action-comedy franchise starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. This time around, the duo finds themselves in Paris on the hunt for a dangerous crime syndicate. While the film doesn&rsquo;t quite reach the heights of the first two movies, it still has plenty of entertaining moments to offer.One of the strengths of the film is the chemistry between Chan and Tucker. They have a great dynamic that brings a lot of humor and heart to the movie. Their classic banter and comedic timing are on full display, and they still manage to pull off some impressive action sequences as well.Speaking of action, this one takes us on a wild journey through Paris, featuring some thrilling set pieces and chase scenes. The city provides a beautiful backdrop for the action, and the film makes great use of its locations.However, the plot can be a bit convoluted at times, with too many twists and turns that don&rsquo;t always make sense. The supporting characters aren&rsquo;t particularly memorable either, and the film relies a bit too heavily on tired stereotypes for some of its humor.Although it&rsquo;s my least favorite of the three, it is not a disaster in any way. If you&rsquo;re looking for some laughs and exciting action, it&rsquo;s worth checking out.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>Rush Hour 2 is a knockout sequel that packs a comedic punch. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are back with their signature banter and over-the-top antics, making for some hilarious moments. The soundtrack is also fire, adding to the fun and energy of the film.The movie doesn&rsquo;t shy away from crude humor and dialogue, which some may find off-putting, but for those who enjoy it, it&rsquo;s a laugh riot. And the female actresses in the film are perfect, adding some much-needed depth and complexity to the story.What really sets this movie apart, though, is the solid ending that ties everything together. Plus, there are tons of references to the first movie that fans will appreciate. Overall, &ldquo;Rush Hour 2&rdquo; is my favorite of the trilogy and definitely worth a watch - just don&rsquo;t rush through it too quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Rush Hour&rdquo; is a unique and entertaining buddy cop movie that has stood the test of time. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker star as a mismatched pair of law enforcement officers who are tasked with finding a kidnapped girl. Along the way, they encounter a slew of dangerous characters and must rely on each other to survive.One of the strengths of the movie is the plot, which keeps the audience engaged and guessing until the very end. The plot twist at the heart of the movie is executed well and adds a layer of depth to the characters and their relationship.Speaking of characters, the acting in &ldquo;Rush Hour&rdquo; is top-notch. Chan and Tucker have great chemistry and their banter is both funny and endearing. They both bring their unique talents to the table - Chan with his impressive martial arts skills and Tucker with his quick wit and humor.The film also features some memorable supporting characters, including the villainous Juntao and the feisty but capable police officer, Sang. They add some variety and depth to the story and keep things interesting.What sets &ldquo;Rush Hour&rdquo; apart from other buddy cop movies is its ability to balance action and humor. The movie is filled with exciting fight scenes and thrilling car chases, but also has plenty of laugh-out-loud moments that make it a fun and enjoyable ride.Overall, &ldquo;Rush Hour&rdquo; is a timeless classic that is definitely worth a rewatch. It may not be perfect, but it&rsquo;s a unique and entertaining film that showcases the talents of its cast and crew. If you&rsquo;re in the mood for some action-packed humor, &ldquo;Rush Hour&rdquo; is a solid choice.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>Get ready for a neon-soaked, violent ride with &ldquo;Only God Forgives.&rdquo; This Ryan Gosling-starrer is a dark and brooding film that&rsquo;s best watched late at night when the world is quiet.Gosling plays his usual role of a silent, hard man battling against the odds and being pushed to his limits. The movie drips neon everywhere, with a unique visual style that&rsquo;s hard to ignore.The plot is interesting but feels short-lived and generic, with only a few moments that truly hit hard. However, those scenes are visually stunning and depict violence in a way that&rsquo;s both shocking and mesmerizing.Overall, this movie is a mixed bag. It has moments of greatness, but they&rsquo;re few and far between. If you&rsquo;re a fan of Gosling or violent, neon-soaked films, give it a watch. But don&rsquo;t expect to be blown away.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>Settle in for a visually stunning journey through the skies with &ldquo;Porco Rosso.&rdquo; While it may not be my favorite Ghibli movie, it still boasts the studio&rsquo;s trademark animation style that&rsquo;s hard to beat.The story is a bit more political and non-traditional than other Ghibli movies, which might not be everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea. But if you&rsquo;re looking for something different and thought-provoking, this movie might just be for you.The character of Porco Rosso is also a standout, a charming and complex protagonist who&rsquo;s hard not to root for. And of course, the visuals are breathtaking, with stunning depictions of flight and aerial combat.Overall, &ldquo;Porco Rosso&rdquo; might not be the most traditional Ghibli movie, but it still has a lot to offer for those looking for a visually stunning and thought-provoking experience.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>Prepare yourself for a dark, psychedelic thrill ride with &ldquo;Infinity Pool,&rdquo; the freshest and most demonic sci-fi adventure in a long time.Mia Goth absolutely slays it with her acting, delivering memorable dialogue and scenes that will stay with you long after the credits roll. And Alexander Skarsgard? He&rsquo;s as cool and sharp as ever.The movie is bursting with gore and sexual energy, with dark and creepy scenes that will make you feel like you&rsquo;re watching an A24 production. It&rsquo;s a rollercoaster of a movie, with twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the very end.If you&rsquo;re a fan of thrillers, sci-fi, and anything with a touch of the demonic, then &ldquo;Infinity Pool&rdquo; is a must-watch. It&rsquo;s my favorite movie of the month and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a dark and unforgettable adventure.</p>

<p><strong>Watched on</strong>: 12 February 2023</p>
<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum is like a scary live-stream that goes viral, but with more ghosts and fewer influencers. The first half sets up the spooky story and the characters, but it moves slower than a snail on a treadmill. The second half delivers the thrills and chills, leaving your brain scrambled like an egg on a hot skillet. And those last 10 minutes? Legendary. But let&rsquo;s be real, you&rsquo;ll need to watch it late at night, by yourself, and with the lights off to fully appreciate the creep factor. Overall, it&rsquo;s worth the watch if you&rsquo;re in the mood for a haunted house tale, just don&rsquo;t expect it to be a scream fest.</p>

<p><strong>Watched on</strong>: 12 February 2023</p>
<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>Incantation is a creepy and culty movie that&rsquo;s not for the faint of heart. While it may not scare everyone, it certainly delivers on the visuals and the alternative vibes. The movie draws from a dark place that can be difficult to relate to, but it&rsquo;s still intriguing to watch. The imagery can be downright terrifying, especially if you&rsquo;re invested in the lore. The PoV scenes are done well and add a nice touch to the film. However, the ending is predictable and overacted, which can detract from the overall experience.If you&rsquo;re into horror movies that involve cults and incantations, this might be up your alley. The movie feels like a cross between The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity, with a ton of lore surrounding the incantation itself. The source material is unique, and the visuals make it worth the watch. But if you&rsquo;re looking for a scream-fest, this might not be the movie for you. Overall, Incantation is worth checking out if you&rsquo;re into the genre, just don&rsquo;t expect it to blow your mind.</p>

<p><strong>Watched on</strong>: 10 February 2023</p>
<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>A Cure for Wellness is a phantasmagorical tale that will take you on a journey through the depths of the human psyche. Mia Goth once again delivers a great performance, and the movie is filled with creepy experiments in basements, shady castles, and Victorian locations that will leave you on edge. I enjoyed the acting, drama, and intimate scenes, but what really stands out is the lore surrounding the central location of the plot. It&rsquo;s all tied together seamlessly, and the ending may be a bit overblown but it&rsquo;s still a satisfying conclusion.Overall, this movie is a must-watch for anyone who loves dark and vividly charming tales. It&rsquo;s a perfect blend of horror and mystery, with a fantastic cast and captivating storyline. The Victorian locations and eerie atmosphere create an immersive experience that&rsquo;s hard to forget. If you&rsquo;re a fan of movies like Crimson Peak, you&rsquo;ll definitely appreciate A Cure for Wellness. So, don&rsquo;t miss out on this gem of a movie!</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>T2 Trainspotting is the long-awaited sequel to the cult classic movie, and it definitely delivers. The jokes are still relevant and updated for the modern age, and the throwbacks and references to the events of the first film are awesome. The same old characters are back, and their charming British rows are a joy to watch.Dialogue and drama are the centerpiece of this movie, with bar fights, epic monologues, and disastrous yet comedic situations that will keep you entertained from start to finish. While the ending may be a bit of a letdown, it&rsquo;s still a self-contained narrative that stands on its own.Overall, T2 Trainspotting is a great movie that will leave you feeling nostalgic and satisfied. It&rsquo;s a must-watch for fans of the original film, and even those who haven&rsquo;t seen it will appreciate the witty dialogue and engaging storyline. So, grab some popcorn and settle in for a wild ride with the gang from Trainspotting!</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Space, the final frontier,&rdquo; or so it goes in &ldquo;Solaris,&rdquo; a sci-fi movie that&rsquo;s about as poetic as it is long-winded. Clocking in at three hours, it&rsquo;s definitely not for the faint of heart, but if you&rsquo;re up for some slow-burn, existential dread, then this might be your cup of tea. The movie&rsquo;s iconic stares and old-school visual effects give it a certain charm, but there&rsquo;s no denying that it&rsquo;s a product of its time. The plot centers around a sentient water body on an alien planet that manipulates the psyche of the people that come into contact with it, exploring the ethics and morality of what it means to be a being. While the narrative does fit well with the book, the movie could have definitely been trimmed down. All in all, &ldquo;Solaris&rdquo; is a tale that&rsquo;s worth checking out if you&rsquo;re in the mood for something slow and thought-provoking.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Spring Breakers&rdquo; is a movie that&rsquo;s all style and no substance. With gratuitous skin shots and an ostentatious display of wealth, it&rsquo;s hard to find any real depth in this flick. The plot is highly unrealistic, following a group of girls who fall for a mob boss and get caught up in a world of gunshots and reckless behavior. While the mob boss does drop a few memorable lines, it&rsquo;s not enough to make up for the lack of substance in the rest of the film. The only redeeming qualities are the good music, some smart jokes and banter, and decent cinematography. Overall, &ldquo;Spring Breakers&rdquo; is a bad dream of a movie that&rsquo;s not worth your time if you&rsquo;re looking for any sort of thrill or excitement. Save your money and watch something else.</p>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<p>Lights, camera, action! &ldquo;Babylon&rdquo; takes us back to the golden age of Hollywood with all the extravagance and drama we&rsquo;ve come to expect. Margot Robbie delivers a standout performance, stealing every scene she&rsquo;s in. The costume and set design are equally over the top, transporting us back to the era in all its glory. What really sets this movie apart is its portrayal of the art and mastery of theatre. The acting is top-notch, and the behind-the-scenes scenes are both intriguing and entertaining. The music choices are also spot on, adding to the overall vibe of the film. &ldquo;Babylon&rdquo; is definitely an over-the-top movie, with a surreal and grounding philosophical touch that feels like it was directed by Tarantino himself. It&rsquo;s a banger of a movie, and a huge artistic milestone. Overall, &ldquo;Babylon&rdquo; is a must-see for anyone who loves the glitz and glamour of old Hollywood.</p>
