      <description>Vol 1: Preludes and Nocturnes But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living â€¦ for the price of wisdom is above rubies. CHORONZON: I am a dire wolf, prey-stalking, lethal prowler. MORPHEUS: I am a hunter, horse-mounted, wolf-stabbing. CHORONZON: I am a horsefly, horse-stinging, hunter-throwing. MORPHEUS: I am a spider, fly-consuming, eight legged.</description>

      <description>Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he&amp;rsquo;s depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, &amp;ldquo;Treatment is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up.&amp;rdquo; Man bursts into tears. Says, &amp;ldquo;But doctor&amp;hellip;I am Pagliacci. Looked at sky through smoke heavy with human fat and God was not there.</description>
