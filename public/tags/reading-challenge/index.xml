      <description>Embarking on a massive high fantasy book series is no small feat, especially when you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a breathtaking, complex, and engaging story that spans decades and continents. As an experienced reader of ASoIaF, WoT, Tchaikovsky&amp;rsquo;s works, Mistborn, and the First Law Trilogy, I knew I needed a challenge that would test my mettle.
Enter the Malazan Book of the Fallen. With rave reviews and a reputation for being one of the most epic fantasy series ever written, it seemed like the perfect choice for me.</description>
