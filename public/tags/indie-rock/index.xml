      <description>Stratosphere, the 1998 slowcore classic by Duster, is a sonic force to be reckoned with. From the minimalist album cover to the dreamy soundscapes, this album evokes a sense of tranquility and longing that is both nostalgic and futuristic. The songs are slow and atmospheric, each one feeling like a journey through space and time, with recurring beats and tempo changes that keep things interesting.
The album&amp;rsquo;s structure is unorthodox and unconventional, with songs flowing into each other seamlessly, creating a hypnotic effect that is both meditative and transportive.</description>
