      <description>Lights, camera, action! March 2023 was a month filled with movie magic, and I had the pleasure of watching some truly amazing films. From thought-provoking dramas to side-splitting comedies, this month had it all. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share my thoughts on the movies I watched, which include the morally challenging First Reformed, the hilarious Game Night, the emotionally charged Spencer, and the classic Edward Scissorhands. I also delved into some cult classics, such as the offbeat Buffalo &amp;lsquo;66 and the spooky Creepshow.</description>

      <description>February was a month for the ages as I indulged in a smorgasbord of movies. From the laugh-out-loud comedy of &amp;ldquo;Rush Hour&amp;rdquo; to the mind-bending sci-fi of &amp;ldquo;Solaris&amp;rdquo; and everything in between, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot to say about the films I watched. There were some classics from the past like &amp;ldquo;Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Porco Rosso,&amp;rdquo; as well as newer releases like &amp;ldquo;Infinity Pool&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Babylon.</description>
