      <description>Lights, camera, action! March 2023 was a month filled with movie magic, and I had the pleasure of watching some truly amazing films. From thought-provoking dramas to side-splitting comedies, this month had it all. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share my thoughts on the movies I watched, which include the morally challenging First Reformed, the hilarious Game Night, the emotionally charged Spencer, and the classic Edward Scissorhands. I also delved into some cult classics, such as the offbeat Buffalo &amp;lsquo;66 and the spooky Creepshow.</description>
