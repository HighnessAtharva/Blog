      <description>Rating: 4/5 ⭐
The Gardens of the Moon, the first volume of the Malazan Book of the Fallen, is a sprawling epic fantasy of monumental proportions. The vast array of characters is not just diverse, but uniquely and exquisitely crafted, and each of their roles is pivotal to the story&amp;rsquo;s advancement. There are no throwaway scenes or chapters; every dialogue and action ripples and reverberates throughout the intricate narrative, creating a vivid tapestry of political intrigue, mystical manipulation, and fantastical landscapes.</description>

      <description>Embarking on a massive high fantasy book series is no small feat, especially when you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a breathtaking, complex, and engaging story that spans decades and continents. As an experienced reader of ASoIaF, WoT, Tchaikovsky&amp;rsquo;s works, Mistborn, and the First Law Trilogy, I knew I needed a challenge that would test my mettle.
Enter the Malazan Book of the Fallen. With rave reviews and a reputation for being one of the most epic fantasy series ever written, it seemed like the perfect choice for me.</description>

      <description>The Blade Itself Once you&amp;rsquo;ve got a task to do, it&amp;rsquo;s better to do it than live with the fear of it. The more you learn, the more you realize how little you know. Still, the struggle itself is worthwhile. Knowledge is the root of power, after all. You have to learn to love the small things in life, like a hot bath. You have to love the small things, when you have nothing else.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s not mess around here. This series has just more than quotes to offer so I have included rich descriptive texts that boil the blood and wake something deep inside. Here&amp;rsquo;s to the good times fellas. Read on for some savage blood-curdling brutalism.

      <description>The Last Wish You make as good a fisherman as a goat’s arse makes a trumpet. &amp;ldquo;Kings,” continued Calanthe, “divide people into two categories—those they order around, and those they buy—because they adhere to the old and banal truth that everyone can be bought. &amp;ldquo;The sun shines differently, the air is different, water is not as it used to be. The things we used to eat, made use of, are dying, diminishing, deteriorating.</description>

      <description>A book is as dangerous as any journey you might take. The person who closes the back cover may not be the same one that opened the front one. Treat them with respect. Your death has not been waiting for your arrival at the appointed hour: it has, for all the years of your life, been racing towards you with the fierce velocity of time&amp;rsquo;s arrow. It cannot be evaded, it cannot be bargained with, deflected or placated.</description>

      <description>Prince of Thorns Memories are dangerous things. You turn them over and over, until you know every touch and corner, but still you&amp;rsquo;ll find an edge to cut you. Each day the memories weigh a little heavier. Each day they drag you down that bit further. You wind them around you, a single thread at a time, and you weave your own shroud, you build a cocoon, and in it madness grows.</description>
