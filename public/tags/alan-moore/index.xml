      <description>Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he&amp;rsquo;s depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, &amp;ldquo;Treatment is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up.&amp;rdquo; Man bursts into tears. Says, &amp;ldquo;But doctor&amp;hellip;I am Pagliacci. Looked at sky through smoke heavy with human fat and God was not there.</description>
