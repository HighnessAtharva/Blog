      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to be reviewing the album &amp;ldquo;Demon Days&amp;rdquo; by Gorillaz, a group that has really put themselves on the map with their unique blend of various genres.

      <description>As a connoisseur of the avant-garde music scene, I was thrilled to dive headfirst into My Bloody Valentine&amp;rsquo;s iconic album, &amp;ldquo;Loveless.&amp;rdquo; And let me tell you, this album is a wild ride, bursting with the iconic and distinguishing shoegazy sound that enraptured me from my very first listen.
It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that &amp;ldquo;Loveless&amp;rdquo; is a masterclass in shoegaze music, with its harsh and distorted rhythms and tunes that feel so close to you, you&amp;rsquo;ll swear you can reach out and touch them.</description>

      <guid>https://atharvashah.netlify.app/posts/personal/music-review/plastic-beach/</guid>
      <description>Gorillaz&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Plastic Beach&amp;rdquo; album is a magnificent work of art that takes the listener on a surreal journey through a digital island filled with both beauty and decay. This is a place where the vibrant colors of the natural world blend with the metallic tones of machinery, and the music echoes that duality with its unique fusion of hip-hop, pop, and psychedelic sounds.
As the third studio album from the animated band, &amp;ldquo;Plastic Beach&amp;rdquo; stands out as a bold and ambitious piece of work that has clearly been meticulously crafted with an acute attention to detail.</description>

      <guid>https://atharvashah.netlify.app/posts/personal/music-review/stratosphere/</guid>
      <description>Stratosphere, the 1998 slowcore classic by Duster, is a sonic force to be reckoned with. From the minimalist album cover to the dreamy soundscapes, this album evokes a sense of tranquility and longing that is both nostalgic and futuristic. The songs are slow and atmospheric, each one feeling like a journey through space and time, with recurring beats and tempo changes that keep things interesting.
The album&amp;rsquo;s structure is unorthodox and unconventional, with songs flowing into each other seamlessly, creating a hypnotic effect that is both meditative and transportive.</description>

      <description>Immersed within the profound literary labyrinth that is Mike Ma&amp;rsquo;s oeuvre, I stumbled upon an enigmatic tapestry of words that left me astounded, pondering why this luminary artist had not yet ascended to the pinnacles of recognition. Within the tapestry of his creations, one finds a captivating amalgamation of satire, philosophy, and humor that defies conventional categorization. Yet, it is not through the predictable lens of conventional narratives that Ma&amp;rsquo;s genius shines.</description>

      <description>Amidst the whirlwind of academic and professional commitments, I managed to carve out precious moments to immerse myself in the magic of cinema. The month of May brought forth an array of highly anticipated films, and while my movie-watching endeavors were limited, the experiences I had were truly captivating. This is partly to blame on TV shows like Better Call Saul which I recently finished and Succession which I just picked up and have been obsessively binge watching.</description>

      <title>Book Review: Deadhouse Gates by Steven Erikson</title>
      <link>https://atharvashah.netlify.app/posts/personal/malazan/02-dg-review/</link>

      <description>Rating: 4/5 ‚≠ê
After reading two books in the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, my impression of the writer&amp;rsquo;s work has shifted slightly. While this book, Deadhouse Gates, connected with me on a character-driven level, its bleakness, plethora of new faces, and the desert setting made it slightly more confusing than the previous book, Gardens of the Moon.
Erikson, known for his world-building skills, takes the already extensive cast of characters and places and expands them even further, leaving little respite for readers who struggled to keep up with the first book.</description>

      <description>Rating: 4/5 ‚≠ê
The Gardens of the Moon, the first volume of the Malazan Book of the Fallen, is a sprawling epic fantasy of monumental proportions. The vast array of characters is not just diverse, but uniquely and exquisitely crafted, and each of their roles is pivotal to the story&amp;rsquo;s advancement. There are no throwaway scenes or chapters; every dialogue and action ripples and reverberates throughout the intricate narrative, creating a vivid tapestry of political intrigue, mystical manipulation, and fantastical landscapes.</description>

      <description>A chieftain of the macabre and the weird, H.P. Lovecraft is one of the most influential horror writers of the 20th century. His stories are filled with the supernatural and the occult and his works have inspired many other writers, including Stephen King, Neil Gaiman, and Clive Barker. Here are some of the best quotes from H.P. Lovecraft. My very personal favorites.
There are not many persons who know what wonders are opened to them in the stories and visions of their youth; for when as children we learn and dream, we think but half-formed thoughts, and when as men we try to remember, we are dulled and prosaic with the poison of life</description>

I also delved into some cult classics, such as the offbeat Buffalo &amp;lsquo;66 and the spooky Creepshow.</description>

There were some classics from the past like &amp;ldquo;Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Porco Rosso,&amp;rdquo; as well as newer releases like &amp;ldquo;Infinity Pool&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Babylon.</description>

      <description>The Blade Itself Once you&amp;rsquo;ve got a task to do, it&amp;rsquo;s better to do it than live with the fear of it. The more you learn, the more you realize how little you know. Still, the struggle itself is worthwhile. Knowledge is the root of power, after all. You have to learn to love the small things in life, like a hot bath. You have to love the small things, when you have nothing else.</description>

Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, &amp;ldquo;Treatment is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up.&amp;rdquo; Man bursts into tears. Says, &amp;ldquo;But doctor&amp;hellip;I am Pagliacci. Looked at sky through smoke heavy with human fat and God was not there.</description>

      <description>A book is as dangerous as any journey you might take. The person who closes the back cover may not be the same one that opened the front one. Treat them with respect. Your death has not been waiting for your arrival at the appointed hour: it has, for all the years of your life, been racing towards you with the fierce velocity of time&amp;rsquo;s arrow. It cannot be evaded, it cannot be bargained with, deflected or placated.</description>

      <description>Prince of Thorns Memories are dangerous things. You turn them over and over, until you know every touch and corner, but still you&amp;rsquo;ll find an edge to cut you. Each day the memories weigh a little heavier. Each day they drag you down that bit further. You wind them around you, a single thread at a time, and you weave your own shroud, you build a cocoon, and in it madness grows.</description>
