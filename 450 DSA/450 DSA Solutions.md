Consider a row of n coins of values v1 . . . vn, where n is even. We play a game against an opponent by alternating turns. In each turn, a player selects either the first or last coin from the row, removes it from the row permanently, and receives the value of the coin. Determine the maximum possible amount of money we can definitely win if we move first.
Note: The opponent is as clever as the user.

Let us understand the problem with few examples:  

5, 3, 7, 10 : The user collects maximum value as 15(10 + 5)
8, 15, 3, 7 : The user collects maximum value as 22(7 + 15)
Does choosing the best at each move gives an optimal solution? No. 
In the second example, this is how the game can be finished:

> User chooses 8. 
> Opponent chooses 15. 
> User chooses 7. 
> Opponent chooses 3. 
Total value collected by user is 15(8 + 7)
> User chooses 7. 
> Opponent chooses 8. 
> User chooses 15.

## [Word Wrap Problem](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/word-wrap/0)

```python
"""   
Given a sequence of words, and a limit on the number of characters that can be put in one line (line width). Put line breaks in the given sequence such that the lines are printed neatly. Assume that the length of each word is smaller than the line width.
The word processors like MS Word do task of placing line breaks. The idea is to have balanced lines. In other words, not have few lines with lots of extra spaces and some lines with small amount of extra spaces. 
 

The extra spaces includes spaces put at the end of every line except the last one.  
The problem is to minimize the following total cost.
 Cost of a line = (Number of extra spaces in the line)^3
 Total Cost = Sum of costs for all lines

For example, consider the following string and line width M = 15
 "Geeks for Geeks presents word wrap problem" 
     
Following is the optimized arrangement of words in 3 lines
Geeks for Geeks
presents word
wrap problem 

The total extra spaces in line 1, line 2 and line 3 are 0, 2 and 3 respectively. 
So optimal value of total cost is 0 + 2*2*2 + 3*3*3 = 35
Please note that the total cost function is not sum of extra spaces, but sum of cubes (or square is also used) of extra spaces.

## [Snake and Ladders Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/snakes-and-ladders/)

```python
"""
On an N x N board, the numbers from 1 to N*N are written boustrophedonically starting from the bottom left of the board, and alternating direction each row. For example, for a 6 x 6 board, the numbers are written as follows:

You start on square 1 of the board (which is always in the last row and first column). Each move, starting from square x, consists of the following:

You choose a destination square S with number x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4, x+5, or x+6, provided this number is <= N*N.
(This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: ie., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.)
If S has a snake or ladder, you move to the destination of that snake or ladder. Otherwise, you move to S. A board square on row r and column c has a “snake or ladder” if board[r][c] != -1. The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c].
Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move: if the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not continue moving. (For example, if the board is [[4,-1],[-1,3]], and on the first move your destination square is 2, then you finish your first move at 3, because you do not continue moving to 4.)

Return the least number of moves required to reach square N*N. If it is not possible, return -1.

```python
"""
You are given an m liter jug and a n liter jug. Both the jugs are initially empty. The jugs don’t have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities. You have to use the jugs to measure d liters of water where d is less than n. 

(X, Y) corresponds to a state where X refers to the amount of water in Jug1 and Y refers to the amount of water in Jug2 
Determine the path from the initial state (xi, yi) to the final state (xf, yf), where (xi, yi) is (0, 0) which indicates both Jugs are initially empty and (xf, yf) indicates a state which could be (0, d) or (d, 0).

The operations you can perform are: 

Empty a Jug, (X, Y)->(0, Y) Empty Jug 1
Fill a Jug, (0, 0)->(X, 0) Fill Jug 1
Pour water from one jug to the other until one of the jugs is either empty or full, (X, Y) -> (X-d, Y+d)

Input : 4 3 2
Output : {(0, 0), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 3), (4, 2), (0, 2)}

## [Can we reverse a linked list in less than O(n) ?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/can-we-reverse-a-linked-list-in-less-than-on/)

```python
It is not possible to reverse a simple singly linked list in less than O(n). A simple singly linked list can only be reversed in O(n) time using recursive and iterative methods. 

A doubly linked list with head and tail pointers while only requiring swapping the head and tail pointers which require lesser operations than a singly linked list can also not be done in less than O(n) since we need to traverse till the end of the list anyway to find the tail node.
```

## [Why Quicksort is preferred for. Arrays and Merge Sort for LinkedLists ?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-quick-sort-preferred-for-arrays-and-merge-sort-for-linked-lists/)

```python
Quick Sort in its general form is an in-place sort (i.e. it doesn’t require any extra storage) whereas merge sort requires O(N) extra storage, N denoting the array size which may be quite expensive. Allocating and de-allocating the extra space used for merge sort increases the running time of the algorithm.
Comparing average complexity we find that both type of sorts have O(NlogN) average complexity but the constants differ. For arrays, merge sort loses due to the use of extra O(N) storage space.
Most practical implementations of Quick Sort use randomized version. The randomized version has expected time complexity of O(nLogn). The worst case is possible in randomized version also, but worst case doesn’t occur for a particular pattern (like sorted array) and randomized Quick Sort works well in practice.
Quick Sort is also a cache friendly sorting algorithm as it has good locality of reference when used for arrays.
Quick Sort is also tail recursive, therefore tail call optimizations is done.

Why is Merge Sort preferred for Linked Lists?
In case of linked lists the case is different mainly due to difference in memory allocation of arrays and linked lists. Unlike arrays, linked list nodes may not be adjacent in memory.
Unlike array, in linked list, we can insert items in the middle in O(1) extra space and O(1) time if we are given reference/pointer to the previous node. Therefore merge operation of merge sort can be implemented without extra space for linked lists.
In arrays, we can do random access as elements are continuous in memory. Let us say we have an integer (4-byte) array A and let the address of A[0] be x then to access A[i], we can directly access the memory at (x + i*4). Unlike arrays, we can not do random access in linked list.
Quick Sort requires a lot of this kind of access. In linked list to access i’th index, we have to travel each and every node from the head to i’th node as we don’t have continuous block of memory. Therefore, the overhead increases for quick sort. Merge sort accesses data sequentially and the need of random access is low.

We can describe the problem input as an array of numbers/characters representing persons in the party. We also have a hypothetical function HaveAcquaintance(A, B) which returns true if A knows B, false otherwise. How can we solve the problem.

## [Distance of nearest cell having 1 in a binary matrix](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/distance-of-nearest-cell-having-1/0)

```python
"""
Given a binary matrix of N x M, containing at least a value 1. The task is to find the distance of nearest 1 in the matrix for each cell. The distance is calculated as |i1 – i2| + |j1 – j2|, where i1, j1 are the row number and column number of the current cell and i2, j2 are the row number and column number of the nearest cell having value 1.

Examples: 

Input : N = 3, M = 4
        mat[][] = { 0, 0, 0, 1,
                    0, 0, 1, 1,

Output : 3 2 1 0
         2 1 0 0
         1 0 0 1
Explanation:
For cell at (0, 0), nearest 1 is at (0, 3),
so distance = (0 - 0) + (3 - 0) = 3.
Similarly, all the distance can be calculated.

## Armstrong Number

```python
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
sum = 0

# find the sum of the cube of each digit
temp = num
while temp > 0:
   digit = temp % 10
   sum += digit ** 3

if num == sum:
   print(num,"is an Armstrong number")
else:
   print(num,"is not an Armstrong number")
```

## Decimal to Binary/Hexadecimal/Octal

```python
dec = 344

print("The decimal value of", dec, "is:")
print(bin(dec), "in binary.")
print(oct(dec), "in octal.")
print(hex(dec), "in hexadecimal.")

```

## GCD

```python

## LCM

```python
def compute_gcd(x, y):
   while(y):
       x, y = y, x % y
   return x

       return n
   else:
       return n*recur_factorial(n-1)

num = 7

   print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
   print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
   print("The factorial of", num, "is", recur_factorial(num))
